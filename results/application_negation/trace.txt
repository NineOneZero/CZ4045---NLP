Original String
I'm sure that there is something that says it will not come pictured, still I was disappointed. The tools helped me get the job done, but they also did not hold up well. The plastic plying tools didn't hold and broke fairly quickly. I can't say that it wasn't user error, but they seemedvery cheap.
