44277,B0050WU2RY,4,Very cute and durable. But it is almost impossible to get off the phone! I almost broke it. But the rhinestones stay on well and it's a cute case.,"10 18, 2013",AT9N630LDSME3,Fun!,1382054400,4
15261,B003DKBX7I,5,This speaker case works as advertised and does a great job. Perfect for kayaking and canoeing. I have used many times and it works well.,"01 26, 2013",AFCAZIM440BI4,Good product,1359158400,3
97934,B008DJIIG8,3,"Perfect fit, very fashionable and doesn't add bulk to the phone (Note 2), but it's a bit slippery, I'm not sure about the amount of protection it will give my phone & the top right hand corner is exposed, not sure why...weird! I do like that the volume rocker is exposed along with the charge outlet, it makes it easier to use...it works for now, but I'm sure I'll eventually purchase something else I can give a 5 star rating...","06 12, 2013",A37JRT04UG92C5,It' OK,1370995200,2
41151,B004ULOZRY,5,"This little device does everything it claims. I use an iPhone 4 and have been wanting a hands-free solution while driving my older 1999 Windstar van without spending $$$ to install a system. I've tried BlueTooth ear pieces and headsets before, but sound quality has been horrendous as is battery life. I saw this Motorola and hoped it would work, and and happy to report that you need to buy one of these ASAP. The sound quality is VERY good for a small device, I have no trouble hearing it at all with the A/C cranked (and believe me, we do a lot of that in Phoenix, already had a 100 degree day in March). But even more of a surprise, the sound quality to the person you are talking to is better than I had hoped. My wife is picky about that, because in the past with other BT devices we've dealt with tinny sound, echo, white noise, you name it. But she says this sounds VERY good and I trust that opinion. I called my work voicemail and left a message to hear what it sounded like, and was equally happy. Understand that a speakerphone sounds like a speakerphone, but there are some that sound good for what they are, and Motorola got it right with this device. Two other big plusses: one is the huge amount of talk time, which I hope lasts a while as batteries do wear down. I'll post back later about that. But the other neat feature is the voice instructions when turning it on: it tells you exactly when to hit the button and connect and how much battery life you have left, same way a GPS device talks to you. Pairing this device is a breeze, and every time I turn it on it instantly connects. Nice! I have found my hands-free solution, and it will work in any car I drive, even rentals when travelling on business. It'll pair with more than one phone so several family members can use it in the family car. I think it's a no-brainer to say ""highly recommended""!***UPDATE: May 11, 2011***I've been using this thing every day and it has been absolutely flawless. It pairs almost instantly, and the sound quality continues to marvel, especially to the person on the other end. All I have to do is turn on Bluetooth on my iPhone 4 when I hop in the van (I don't leave BT on 24/7, just wastes battery life), and then I turn on this X500 and in seconds the female voice says connected and reports the battery life (Low, Medium, or High). I've charged it ONCE the day I reviewed it and it's still going, battery level ""High"". Great device.","04 26, 2011",A3EZFFPVS34AMO,"I was skeptical at first, but now I'm SOLD",1303776000,23
22278,B003XDU8OO,4,"I have to say that I almost took a star off my review for the terrible packaging this headset came in. Not only was it ridiculously difficult to remove, I was worried I might break the unit getting it out of the packaging. Egads! Also, what ships in this large package is just the headset unit, the power cable and a pamphlet of docs. All of this would have fit in a box / package 5 times smaller than what it shipped in. Clearly the packaging was meant to stand up vertically and be displayed at ATT or some other retail cell location. All this being said I am not rating this headset based on the docs. (But I wanted to!). First let me say I am not a bluetooth headset expert, I briefly owned the apple bluetooth headset for the iphone but returned it. I also tried the altec lansing stereo bluetooth headphone / headset to less than stellar results. Since those experiments, I just used the very nice apple headphone with the built in mic and volume controls (the ones you buy separate for the iphone for about $40).  I just found those to be very easy and I can listen to music while I work or drive and then also make or take calls easily. Also you don't need to charge them up. Pros of the M1000R BT Headset:Small, lightweight design, you barely feel it in your ear. It uses both a wrap around ear holder or also a new soft rubber ""plug"". I don't know how to describe it but it works very well. You choose which works better. I liked the plug a lot. Comes with 3 sizes of the rubber ""plug"" (ok i need to find out the right word) and it's very comfortable and stays in place. This was well researched and designed. Call quality is strong, loud, i tested it 10-20 feet away with no problems. I could get used to this. There is a built in voice that tells you the status, volume level, battery life.... snazzy. It seems to work flawlessly with the iphone 4 (paired perfectly), all functions worked. You hold the headset button down to activate the iphone's voice dial feature. Battery life seems strong, says 6 hours, haven't talked enough to know for sure. Charges very fast. You power it off with a slider rocker, I like that, sometimes you never know if it's on or off with the soft click buttons. Cons: (not many)Packaging sucked, yeah I know, move on. Only comes with a home charger, its nice and small, but would some sort of combo auto charger be a lot to ask? Pressing the call button sort of squishes your ear, it's a hard press. Maybe it will soften up over time. There are are 3 buttons on the unit - power, call functions, and volume. This is fine but the docs come with a big list of functions that you either single tap or double tap to enable. Many of these are based on the status of your call. If its an active call the taps do different things, it's the call was lost they try to redial or reconnect. It just seems a little complicated considering you are likely to be driving in the car, etc. I dunno, maybe this is the best way to go. The basic functions work fine using the tap to take a call and the volume to adjust. The voice dial function takes a little getting used to, You hold down the call button for 2 secs, then it bongs at you, but that signal is just telling the iphone to start its voice dial function. So then you wait to hear the iphone's sort of double bong that means you can now give your voice command. It takes some getting used to, I wasn't sure how long to hold the button down for and when to speak. it seems I was always talking too soon or too late. All in all, a great headset for the $$.","08 25, 2010",AONUCJBC85BL,"Very nice, works great with iphone 4.",1282694400,44
