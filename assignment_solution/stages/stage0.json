{"id": "001", "text": "good not quite what I expected but good very clear so far its a nightmare. no directions and I cant figure out how it works. whats wrong with directions coming with watch.????? I have a large wrist, and the large fits just snugly enough not to move much and still be comfortable. Purchased nearly 2 months ago, I love the ability to track my sleep patterns and how active I was throughout the day. I have had no problems with this band at all, although I rarely wear it in the shower. I have heard that water damage is the #1 cause of problems with this device. (It is water RESISTANT, not water PROOF). I do find that I have been eating healthier and trying to walk more to get my numbers up to beat my friends. That could yield a healthier lifestyle Keeping a clear work space is good for your health, your environment, as well as your insanity. Did you know that a messy and unorganized workplace will keep your mind busy and increase the chance of your forgetting to complete things. It's true fact and RAVPower has produced a solution to this little problem. It's a little box better known as the 4-Port Wall Charger.The name of this little accessory is actually a little false but in a good way, that is. You will understand once you read the review and picture having this in your very home.What's in the Box?Before I can give you all the information and details about the 4-Port Wall Charger I must refresh your memory on what else you receive;- RAVPower 4-Port Wall Charger- AC Wall Port (Country Specific)- User ManualThey included everything that the average consumer would need but I do wish they could of had also included a shorten cable for the Lightning Port/Micro USB as a little bonus.Where Does the RAVPower 4-Port Wall Charger (RP-UC07) Exceed?To be honest, this is my first ever accessory that I can actually use on my device past my testing period. In other words, I use this bad boy every single day since I like charging my devices up at night for a full battery and use the next day.I have tested and used USB hubs but they're not for me since they receive a wall outlet power source AND a USB connection to your computer. I don't like having a bunch of devices connected to my computer so the 4-Port Wall Charger is a life saver. I can simply walk to it, plug in my shorten Micro USB cable, and begin charging my Nokia Lumia 810 right away. It's that simple!Where Does the RAVPower 4-Port Wall Charger (RP-UC07) Lack?There's actually nothing really bad about this little accessory. I like that it's offer in two colors (black or white) and the fact that it's not glossy is more than a single reason for you to add this to your shopping list. The only real improvement that I recommend to RAVPower is that they include an On/Off switch to help save energy.Having it on all the time isn't ideal, a waste of power, and kind of annoying when that blue light is always shining at you at night - or is that just me? Either way, an On/Off switch would be a great addition and improvement.How the RAVPower 4-Port Wall Charger (RP-UC07) Fit in my Life?Personally, I will be using this on a daily basis to continue charging my devices, in this case; my Samsung Galaxy S4, Nokia Lumia 810, and anything else that may need a little boost to make it through the day or at least part of the day.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?For those that are OCD, a neat-freak, or just like to keep things nice and tidy (referring to cable management and such) then I highly recommend picking yours up today! I have yet to review anything else like the 4-Port USB Wall Charger and probably won't for a while, to be honest with you all. I love this case! I have used this now for about a month and  it's holding up pretty good. I do like the pockets for my license and other cards. I do make sure the magnetic strip is towards the binding of the case to make sure the strip doesn't get erased by the magnetic flap lock. It has saved my phone a few times since I am prone to dropping my cell (bit clumsy :P). I bought the Anker Tempered Glass Screen Protector for the following reasons, and I am so happy I did:1. Spigen SGP's tempered glass screen protectors let me down for the final time (explained below).2. Anker's gives you better tempered glass at a fraction of their competitors' prices.When I got my Galaxy S5, I bought several of Spigen's tempered glass screen protectors. I wrote glowing reviews of them. However, each and every one of Spigen's glass protectors always ended up with mysterious cracks or scratches on the glass. I returned them time and time again and decided to look elsewhere.I then noticed Anker's tempered glass and their much lower prices. Of course, I was very skeptical. If the competitor's charge $35 to $40 for a glass screen protector, why does Anker charge so little? There must be a catch right???NO. NO CATCH. Anker's tempered glass screen protectors are superior to Spigen SGP's. Period.Anker's customer service is outstanding. When I received my tempered glass screen protector, I installed it as instructed. However, I got the rainbow effect. I contacted their Support and they sent me a brand new replacement, absolutely free of charge!Save your money and buy your tempered glass screen protectors from Anker. They have a quality product that is better than their main competitors. great length and looks and feels great but the second i plugged it in it was already having problems charging my note 2. If it isn't at the right angle it won't charge. Quite irritating if you leave your phone for 3 hours thinking its charging only to come back and find it dying. Arrived on 3 Jul and all was well until I dropped my phone for the first time at 8 a.m. on 18 July. It fell almost face down on a concrete floor from waist high. Wasn't too concerned because the &#34;new case&#34; would protect my Galaxy S5 but boy was I wrong. At first I thought it was just that the phone needed to be reset but it was much more and worst. Screen survived but LCD cracked--hairline fracture!!!! Phone comes on but only get the black screen. I can hear texts/phone ringing and it does light up but there is no access to anything. Checked out a new LCD w/ screen attached and it's averaging $170, if I send out to fix they want over $280 here in Miami/Ft Lauderdale..Case fit properly, looks good, feels great in your hand, and does hold a charge for about 2 days but it DOES NOT protect the phone if you drop it! Smoothe, Soft/ Hard, all in one . Very Nice. Love it! The soft part in the back has started peeling off & did so a few days after I put it in... but it does keep my phone safe... I have a trip coming up next week and I needed to have someway to charge my Kindle so I could read during the trip. I am extremely pleased with this product. It does exactly what it claims to do. I like the idea that I can charge this product 2 ways - Solar and electricity. It makes a great backup for my ereader and my cell phone. Well made cable. Better than the standard apple 8-pin lighting cable in terms of quality. Charges the iPhone at a good speed. Very nice cable. Fit and plugs into device without problems. Like oem, possibly even better. Package is beautiful. Charged quickly. Handy to have another charging cable to travel to work with. 4 feet long, so nice length. Used this in a makeshift conference room at work. Everyone loved it. Easy to install, great call quality, and the buttons on the device are really handy. I definitely wouldn't use this in a very large conference room, but for a standard conference table with 6-8 people around it you'll be fine. Initially these were a gift for my daughter.  They didn't catch on with her, so I took them over.  Matter of fact, using them right now.  I'm surprised at how clear and easy they are to use.  Also, seems like I rarely charge them.I'd buy these again if the ones I had stopped working. They are comfortable, fold up nicely and have little problem connecting. It seems very durable. I've had it for over a month and it still looks brand new. The IPhone 4 fits perfectly and I store my earphones in the back compartment. I do not use this case as a wallet but it's a great method for holding my IPhone and earphones. Excellent case and protection for the phone, none better. Liked it, just prefer other brands Has very good construction and finish but has a major feature missing: doesn't have any indicator light to inform it's connected or has power.  This indicator light would also serve to locate the ports in the dark.  With this simple feature it would be a great product. Took this on a road trip. Worked great with a plethora of devices, including iPads and newer smart phones. All charged very quickly. Charges two phones simultaneously without a hitch.  Other chargers I've had would split power or not provide full power when 2 items were plugged in.  Not this one. I'm very happy with my order Product looked worned I love love love this case.  I don't go in for big cases and even often opt for no case at all.  This case is minimalist enough to fit my preference.  Champagne Gold is a unique color that makes my phone stand out without being gaudy. I took off some stars because once the pack is charged it doesn't automatically start to charge the phone. you have to manually switch it over. But you get what you pay for. I would not purchase another I would look for a higher quality. Also you must use the apple earbuds with it on your phone because the hole is so small.The phone does stay in the case very well even though the top half of the phone is exposed and exposed to drops.It does charge the phone so at least you have that. works great on my note 8.0 Very practical, i use it to leasent music from my ipod, to see vidios, but what i like must its that i conect it to a spiker i control the muisic from distant truh bluetooth. Now I can hook my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 up to my TV using the HDMI and not have to string extension cords all over to do it. THIS WIRE WERE NOT FOR A NOTE 2 AT ALL AND I DO NEED TO RETURN THEM... USELESS , THANKS FOR ASKING... mARIA Seriously this is an awesome case. I've only used it now for less than a week but it is sturdy and the belt clip is perfect. I know I am going to drop my phone and I really think this will protect it when I do. While most matte screen protectors create multicolored static fuzz on the screen, this one does a lot better.  It's also holding up well, and feels smooth (not abrasive or sticky) during use.Application was easy and took me just a minute.  I would buy this again, but I'm pretty sure these three will outlast the phone. This tripod wasn't very stable when I used my Galaxy S5 on it.  The iPhone 4S should be fine, and eventhe iPhone 5/5s/5c may work.  But anything bigger would be too much for this little tripod. Good phone worked great Always quality products from spigen awesome Spend a little more for a better product. Never received the actual S4 Charger. Micro USB connection is loose after a week of very minimal usage, was lose from the get-go. Just spend a couple extra bucks for a better product. Great product. Was easy to use. I used a hairdryer for an hour on the broken screen to heat the glue. Follow the instructions CAREFULLY and you'll have a new screen! It occasionally gets stuck if I press too hard, and I have to black out the screen for a second and turn it back on, but it works. Beats paying $100-150 for a new phone from insurance. Good sound and volume. Excellent deal for this price,I had would prefer its shape and size different, but it works as promised. This review is for the 18W charger. Amazon messed up the product numbers and this review will show up for the 24W Anker charger. I've been using it for 7 months now and it hold well so far. It charges Moto X or Nexus 4 at a rate of 24% per hour when it's on and that's as fast as the original wall charger. I did not use the 2nd port so far so I don't know how fast it charges 2 phones at the same time. I just wish the built-in cord was a 2 inches longer. Got the tip from the TWIT network and very happy with it.  Charges my Note 3. These are the best. I use them all the time on my iPad. Only personal preference - they could be a little heavier.They don't feel cheap to me, just light.And they HAVE A PEN!!! I have used many headphones before, so I have a very good idea of what headphones need to sound like.Plantronics is a great headphones:Sound quality is great the bass is very good for a small Bluetooth headphones.Fit factor: The headphones fits very nicely and snugly I do very intensive workouts with it.Battery life: is not the best but it is amazing comparing to the size of the headphones. (The charging case is a great edition to make sure your headphones are charged while in your bag)Connectivity: it is easy to connect and pair with your phone, I love the ability to pair to 8 devices.After all:It is a very good headphones, and yes I do recommend it over many other Bluetooth headphones on Amazon. The price is not bad for the great sound quality the headphones offer. Finding a durable, attractive, and cost-conscious Iphone case is hard. You literally have thousands of choices to select from and I know you've bought a few you regret sinking money into.... I assure you this will not be one of those.Let's check of the list:+ Under $20.Don't have to give a arm and a leg for some ridiculous quality. And I mean SWANKY.+Speaking of Quality...Well constructed, weighty (in a good way)+Brilliant DesignThere is webbing inside and it is multilayered.Also the phone has great Bezeling (Basically, the screen doesn't poke out farther than the screen protects. Meaning if you drop it face first, it hits the edges of the case before the screen, if at all). Also has a super slim body.+ Colors/AestheticsIt also comes in so many classic, classy, and complimentary colors and to your iphone (I chose indigo). I get quite a few compliments for how classy my case looks over those cheap jelly bumpers that never seem to do the job.+ FunctionThe side buttons, the power buttons, the spacing for the earjack (**IMPORTANT**) is all excellent and well accommodated for.If you can make one purchase, PLEASE do yourself a favor by saving money and time by purchasing this case. Look at all the reviews this case has and tell me that it's not a fluke.5/5 ***** MY PERSONAL IPHONE 5S CASE. I love spigen products, so far I've had about 3 and they've all been really good products.  I love variety so I buy an assortment of items for my phone quite often and this brand is top notch. I am very sure that Anker external batteries are ones of the best in the market. Good quality and finishing. This is the 3rd battery I purchased from Anker, and as today they are working very good ( I hope it will continue in the same way, if not I will come and say it) This Lasted 2 months before I got a product incompatible message and then it refused to charge my iPhone.Can't recommend. It works perfectly with my Note 3 and my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2. this is one of the worst cases I have ever used! what is water proof about this product or anything? this product destroyed my phone and nobody wanted to help replace my phone! I would not ever sell this product to anyone, the person whom invented this product needs to go back and never try building something like this again! it is complete garbage!!!! This is probably the BEST external battery charger I've ever had. I love how quickly it charges my phone and the sleekness of the product. It stays charged for a long time without ever using it, which is a plus. Just keep in my purse at all times and have used it more than I thought I would! Will buy more as gifts. This charger doesn't seem to hold a charge longer than a day. I used my amPen stylus daily and wear down the tips quickly.  It is a great idea to have replacement tips.  The mesh tip is so much better than the rubber tips.  I use the amPen stylus for my iPhone and iPad and it works great!  Highly recommend both. This well-designed power bank takes about twelve hours to fully charge. (It was at 9% when I plugged it in for a charge the first time.) The LED light will indicate at what percentage power the bank is working off of, which is very helpful when on the road and having to schedule charges. My device came with a three-prong cable so I could charge my Samsung phone and my Samsung tablet concurrently. The Samsung tablet plug turned out to defective, so I had to use the plug that came with my tablet to get it to charge. I had no trouble charging my Samsung phone with the enclosed cable.While this bank needs 12 hours to fully charge up, it is much faster at charging up devices plugged into it. It took my phone 15 minutes to charge up from 93% to 100%. It took my tablet the same time to charge from 96% to 100%.This bank holds a full charge at least a day before it drops below 100%. One thing I did notice is that the bank will automatically lose 3% when a device is plugged into it.The device comes with a fitted felt carrying case. The flashlight is activated by quickly pressing twice on the button. The light isn't very bright, but helpful when trying to look at small electronic devices. Instructions for this come on a small fold, which is very hard to readI received a free copy in exchange for an honest review. The LCD is nice but I have yet to gauge its accuracy. The flashlight is a simple 5mm LED and not a particularly nice one. It has an extremely violet tinge and isn't very bright.The battery doesn't charge devices while it is being charged itself.Plugging an iPhone into the 1A port does nothing and no manner of button pushing will cause it ti turn on. Plugging the iPhone into the 2.1A port and pushing the button turns the battery pack on and then the phone can be switched to the 1A jack.The manual seems like it was translated from Chinese to English using a simple app and the text is so small that some of the characters were nearing the limits of the printer.Overall a cheaply built device, but not bad for $20.23. My personal choice to power all my devices on the go. Full disclosure: I was sent this Power Bank to try out and review. When it came in the mail I didn't even understand what it was supposed to do, but I realized I could plug it in to one of my chargers (which I use for my Kindle, blackberry, playbook, etc.) and it began charging. It was fully charged (red light went out) in about 5 hours. I unplugged it and then examined all of the connectors it comes with. Most of them I didn't recognize, as I have never had an iPhone, for example, and I don't use a laptop, but there are certainly connectors for any device you have. I sat down to read my Kindle and the &#34;low battery&#34; notice came on. Normally, this means that I have to stop reading, and go plug my Kindle into the charger, which is not a convenient place to sit and keep reading. Voila...a use for the power bank! I plugged it into my Kindle, and was able to keep reading while my Kindle completely powered up again! This alone makes it useful for me, but I can definitely see keeping it charged up and taking it with me for &#34;power emergencies.&#34; It is a great little device and I am happy to have it.  Keep in mind, it does not stay charged for very long, (if I let it sit over night, it no longer gives me any power,) but it is useful in emergencies. Great external battery that has saved me on multiple occasions when my Iphone ran out of battery. Light as a feather (well almost), I hardly knew I was carrying it around in my handbag all day long. Out of all of the power banks that I have experienced, this product charged the quickest. It went from 4% battery life left on my mobile, to 54% in a very short time, and then almost to full. I think I may need to leave it longer to charge prior to taking it out for the day, but needless to say, I had enough battery power to keep my mobile charged until I returned home. The design is sleek and attractive, and very simple to use. When I want lightness, this will be my choice of battery charger to take out and about, which will be most of the time! The high capacity power bank is PERFECT for those high demand electronics - both during summer storm season, winter storm season and all those summer treks to the park, the beach, or the cabin where power is not as readily available.  The OXA works well among the many brands. Having worked in disaster work and been a road warrior, I find devices such as this invaluable.  I keep several USB LED lamps handy - it's a great emergency lighting system when the power goes out! Though I received the OXA external battery for reviewing purposes it's been working great for a few months now, I highly recommend! Consider this one of my best purchase last year, it charges my easyac battery pack.A little awkward to set up, I had to use 550 cord and some creative lashing to get it set in the right place.Folds up well, very well built. Beautifully designed and functional. Great product.  Works as expected. The extra USB connection is really nice to have. Fits perfectly on my note3 from uscellular... has plenty of space for my cards... Easy access to the charger and headphone outlet... magnet has a nice solid grip... Haven't really used the stand part... Nice case. A FRIEND OF MINE BOUGHT THIS AND TOLD ME I SHOULD LEAVE A REVIEW TELLING THE AMAZON CUSTOMERS HOWGREAT IT IS locks INTO PLACE HOLDS THE PHONE,OR NAVI IN PLACE WITHOUT ANY BUMPS AND SHAKING REALLY A GREAT PIECENIC EJOB I gave 4 stars but ? Feeling generous montong mesnsvtzkeboutvofvcasecsbsp on white cover screw on lens. Sobtravelin onnpvjeyblida a hassle but acoetmansyr mount on dolidctri pod notvchespnflex would be cool. I gave high hopes to be a better photog without useing big bucks I made the move from an iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 about 4 months ago. Since then, it's brought me nothing but trouble. I have to restart the phone on a daily basis just to make calls, the phone constantly overheats, and doesn't hold a charge for longer than 6hrs on standby.  I've never downloaded games or any other questionable apps. The phone is just crap compared to the iPhone. It's a great accesory. It allows you to do many things without waking up your phone. However, the material used to make the window should be better. It holds many fingerprints and dirt. adds the convenience of wireless charging sacrificing thinness on the note3 . installation was just taking the old cover off....and putting this one on. like I said it does add a little bulk  but its up to you to decide end of the day. well built cover though. Perfect and just what I was looking for.  Two bigger batteries  and a charger.  Works like a champ and good price too. Like every OtterBox I've purchased, this beastly case paid for itself several times in the first month I owned it. My Galaxy Note 3 is quite safe inside this case and I don't worry about carrying such a large (and potentially fragile) device around with me. Yes, it will make your already large Note 3 a bit bigger - but worthy every millimeter.My only complaint is that I can't find a decent desktop docking station that will accommodate the size of this case. Not a big deal though. It fits any cell phone, and grip is very strong. I love this product. It is very easy to set up and grips firmly Gave this as a gift to a friend who liked it very much..was happy at how quickly it got here and how nicely it fit her phone..She is a Seahawk fan so liked the colr but wishes it were truer to their color.. Such a cool pen with stylus.  No more carrying two things with me. I would definitely recommend. Mine must be defective because I can't get the pack to hold a charge or charge anything else. The ultra high capacity power bank is PERFECT for those high demand electronics - both during summer storm season, winter storm season and all those summer treks to the park, the beach, or the cabin where power is not as readily available.  Having worked in disaster work and been a road warrior, I find devices such as this invaluable.  I keep several USB LED lamps handy - it's a great emergency lighting system when the power goes out! Though I received the OXA external battery for reviewing purposes, it's been working great, I highly recommend! This little box is the best. Hooked it up to my Bluetooth receiver and my smart tv and man my tv sound is excellent now. Also my kindle plays well from it. Get y load and easy to set up, no problem at all. I love this case! it is everything that a case should be and more! I got one for my dad whom just got his phone destroyed by a ( life proof case )! now he loves it also. for sure in a score of 1-10? this case is for sure a 20!!!! It is good if you want to decorate yourself, which is what I did with fabric paint.  It looks to be leather but if it is it is not of high quality. It might NOT be actual leather as there is a petrol smell to it hence the 1 star as I do not like deceit in advertising.  Also, you cannot use as a wallet, it will not stay shut if you add anything like money or cards even though there is a place for them, the spine is not wide enough to accommodate the extra width so it flaps open all the time.  But will keep as it is too expensive to send back, will see if they refund my money anyway since it really does not work and I will probably give it to GoodWill anyway. falls off your phone and does not protect your phone in any way At first I considered returning this battery pack to Anker. However a customer service rep reached out and said they really stand behind the pack. As a replacement to the Mophie Juice Pack, I thought -- why not give them a good spin. I am using this on an iPhone 5 32GB model on the AT&T; NetworkPros:Power ON! When I need the recharge at work, it's just a push button a way.Easy to hold. I'm not afraid of dropping this as the sides and back hold perfectlyPlenty of power. I can recharge my phone, fully, and then have some power leftCons:The side input has me concerned it may weaken over timeInput error: sometimes a not compatible warning comes up. I reinsert and no issues.In all, easy to use. As I indicated, this is a replacement to a Mophie Juice Pack. I have had the phone (and the pack) for about two years. The Amazon Prime price was attractive. I initially wanted to return this but in all, I'm pleased with the battery pack. It's important to read the directions all the way; and I did not. (Which contributed to my error.)I kicked tested this on a trip to New York and back to California. No electrons were lost and I could charge my phone with easy. Also, customer support is truly that: they have answered my questions in hours during the day. That speaks volumes. Thoroughly impressed by this little speaker. I took it camping with me over a 4-day weekend and it performed admirably. I used it solely with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The description states that it gives up to 7 hours of play-time per charge but I didn't have to re-charge it at all over the weekend (though it was mostly played off and on for 4 days). While setting up for camping, it even fell off the roof of my car at one point and landed squarely on the concrete - not a scratch on it!The sound quality is surprising, to say the least. Don't expect home theater quality sound from it but it's definitely a rival for some larger Bluetooth speakers that I've worked with. The music was rich and clear, with a goodly amount of bass. I definitely recommend this little guy for all of your compact Bluetooth speaker needs.::Pros-Compact & durable design with rubbery grip-Great sound quality-Good battery life-Decent Bluetooth range (did not actually measure distance)-Charging indicator light::Cons-USB Mini-B, instead of USB Micro-B-No &#34;powered on&#34; indicator light Nice looking and very functional phone case. Slips on easily and is secure. The clear back is kinda cool and you can personalize the phone by adding graphics inside the clear cover. It comes with a couple of generic pictures, but you could use them as a template to make by our own. I have phones that are capable of charging at 1.8Ah (a Note 3 and a GS5) and they're both capable of receiving the full 1.8Ah charge at the SAME TIME, which is awesome! Just make sure you're using a compatible USB cable that can give those currents. Too big for iPhone 5C Slim, which is nice.  But, also a bit flimsy.  Good for the price. love it Sticky as can be. It bounces around quite a bit. this is great Nice looking and functions well. If you are looking for a slimmer type case this is not the one because it is a little bulky. Doesn't bother me because I prefer a little cushion - makes me feel like it will protect the phone better. Fits my Nexus 5 perfectly. I bought this for my son and he loves it!  He dropped in yesterday and it protected it!  He loves it! LED indicator light is what sold it.The powered blue leds are pretty much the best thing ever. My wife always got nervous about power peripherals draining her car battery. Now with the simple indication of being powered or not she's finally comfortable with this. Simple product that fixes a common problem. As a family of 3 we all have phones and tablet and sometimes we need to charge more than one device at a time in the car, and this does the trick! Small so doesn't take much space. Well built, will purchase another for my wife's car. This product works great. I am able to charge my phone and my Glass at the same time without any issues. My only complaint is the cable is kinda short so i don't really use that much. However all in all this device works great and i have been loving it. First Impressions:The case came in nice packaging with decent instructions on the back of the box. Though it might be helpful if they threw a little note inside the case which says something like (see instructions for installation). Normally, I don&#8217;t think a person would look at instructions for a case but I found that in this instance you put the phone in the case in the opposite order than expected. The material has a nice feel to it and has a good combination of hard and soft materials. The soft material has a slightly rubbery feel and seems to be quite grippy.Buttons and Flaps:The port flaps as a whole are a little tough to open but I think this is a good thing. They feel quite solid and sturdy and seem as though they would last quite a while. The same with the sleep and volume buttons, they have a great feel and are sturdy and flexible. That being said I have a couple gripes on a couple flaps.I&#8217;m not a fan of the silent flap. I&#8217;d really like to see something else done here. It&#8217;s nice the flap is there for protection but it just makes it too difficult for a person who uses the slider quite frequently to access. A company that did it right is called Lunatik with their Siesmic case. It&#8217;s fully covered and uses a bar that slides back and forth to toggle the silent button. I think this case could greatly benefit from something like this.The power/lightning flap also causes a problem for me. I like to dock my phone both in the car and at night in the alarm clock. I know a lot of cases make this difficult but I can usually find a way around it. But with this case it&#8217;s simply impossible without cutting the flap off. With the flap opening to the rear it would mean you&#8217;d have to completely fold the flap back 270 degrees to have any chance of resting this case in a dock with a back on it. If the flap opened to the front it would only need to open 90 or at most 180 degrees and there would need be anything block the face of the iPhone.The button home button cover is impressive and weird at the same time. As a user of the touch ID feature on my 5s I was wondering how that would play out with this case. The material which covers the button on this case is a little funky in that it seems like plastic wrap. It does a fantastic job but really looks kinda bad in my opinion. It doesn&#8217;t stay stuck down to the home button which makes it look all bubbly. I would suggest maybe a slight adhesive of some sort so that it adheres to the home button which would improve the looks as well.Screen Protection:I&#8217;m not usually a fan of screen covers built into the case. This one isn&#8217;t terrible though. It does a good job of laying flap against the face of the phone and not looking all bubbly like many other cases. That being said I do still see some waviness while using the phone which can be distracting. It&#8217;s more noticeable near the home button due to the nature of stamping the plastic surface for the cut out.Back Plates:I greatly appreciate the 3 different back plates and like the fact that it&#8217;s just the 3 colors of the iPhone. I like the stock look of an iPhone so trying to emulate that is great in my book. It MAY deter some users from purchasing who like to go all colorful though. Maybe New Trent should sell another version with 3 colored back plates or maybe sell a set of colored plates separately. Just a thought.Fit and Finish:This case has great fit and finish. The buttons and ports all line up perfectly and there is no flashing (extra plastic) to be found anywhere. The materials are high quality with a great feel.Overall:I think this is a great case even with a few caveats. The case adds a little weight and size to the phone but not terribly so for the amount of protection. As an office worker though this case is not for me. My phone is rarely open to the elements and doesn&#8217;t need a lot of protection which is why I usually just opt for a bumper. That being said I think this is the ideal case for a construction worker. Seeing as how they have their phone on them at all times the weight/size to protection ratio is perfect. It&#8217;s water resistant so when they get caught in the rain on a job they will be covered. I&#8217;d happily recommend this case to any blue collar workers whom asked for a great case on the job. Love this brand, excelent product, Full iphone protection and ability to change the back plate which comes in 3 colors. Great for extreme sports as it protects the iphone from dirt and watter. Good case, get lots of compliments, especially from those who bought a much more expensive alternative at a big box store (you know what I am referring to).However, I leave it as a 4/5 because the thumb scanner is sub-par and rather annoying to use.  I purchased one for my gf as well and she complains about the same problem, so much so that she doesn't even use it anymore.Again, the case is cheaper than the competitors out there, so I was factoring this issue in when I bought it.  If you are a &#34;thumb scanner&#34; only person to unlock your phone, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I was previously using a lifeproof case for my iPhone 5, but it started getting worn out and decided its time to get a new one.Upon unpacking the case it comes with a soft TPU inner shell w/built in screen protector, a poly carbonate outer shell, and 3 different back accents gold, silver and black.The case was very straightforward to put on and instructions were clearly detailed on the back of the packaging. I put the case on in less than a minute.The things that I really like about this case compared to my lifeproof is:Cost (bargain price @ $30)Thinner (case is not bulky at all, feels great holding it)Screen cover (retains the sensitivity of the screen, its as if there is no protector on there at all)Durable (dropped this thing from about 3 feet on the sidewalk and it left no visible markings on the case)Port covers (attached to case)All in all I really love this case. At this price point I think its the best case out there. I wish I had known about this before buying the lifeproof which I paid over $75 for. I  had an OtterBox commuter for my iPhone 5.  Since the iPhone 5 and the OtterBox commuter are thinner, I was able to store the phone in my pant pocket.  I then upgraded to the iPhone 5S because of the TouchID security and a better processor.  Of course, I want a rugged case thinner than the OtterBox. The salesman showed me a case by Ballistic which is a comparable rugged case but thinner.  The Ballistic case fits comfortably in my pant pocket.  All the rugged cases on the market, at the time,seal the home button on the phone thereby  forfeiting  the TouchID security.  I choose a rugged case over the TouchID.  Small compromise!  I thought.New Trent's NT630CR is as thin as my Ballistic case and allows for the TouchID to work and is a rugged case.  I accidentally dropped the case on my cement driveway  when removing the phone from my pant pocket.  This case takes a licking and keeps working.  The hard inner case and the outer TPU case protect the phone from most accidental oopses.  The scratch proof film of the inner case is very clear and responsive to the touch.  The TouchID works great.The outer shell has very tight port covers to eliminate dust etc.  I was disappointed when my after market charger cord would not fit into the phone.  The inner case was preventing the charger from making connection.  Used an apple charger problem solved.The  back cover adds a touch of panache and  class.This case is a keeper and will remain on my iPhone until apple changes the iPhone size.Excellent job New Trent you did it again! great price on a back up cable for my s5 love this product i love the light it works really good i recommended it charges  ur phone fast This case fit wonderfully, I really love the case but you need to come up with tweety bird cases. That is the cases I really would like Good case. I love the color blue. Unfortunately the blue rubber gets blackened pretty easily with everyday wear. The silicone is of high quality and is very rugged unlike your typical silicone covers. Wraps around the moto g like a glove and is a very tight fit. The outer shell provides extra structure and holds the silicone in its place. The kick stand is a very neat idea and works great. I have had this case now for a couple of months and really enjoy it. I have other cases but always put this one back on. Nice protection in a slim profile. I would recommend this case to anyone. Don't let the price fool you because this is an awesome case. And I'm very picky about stuff like this. Great case! Like so many of the other generic/non-Apple lightning charger cables, the tip of the lightning connector is bigger than your original Apple lightning charging cord.  As a result, it did not fit through my case. Make sure your case has a large opening for the charger; otherwise, you'll have to remove the case every time you want to charge it. Case was purchased as a gift, the recipient really love the case - stated that it was perfect and look brilliant on the Note 3 - So kudos.... As today, this is the worst USB charging cable I ever seen and bought. I am requesting refund, and waiting for seller's response.I used twice thinking I was wrong  in the first time, but I confirmed it, this cable only charge at a 1/3 of speed of other common , non special charging cable.I wasted time waiting for it, hope a refund will be made. Hard to see the screen it looks blurry Fits well ... protects the phone ... not much else you could ask for. Arrived 3 days earlier than estimated and screen worked great and was decently priced!  I would recommend to someone looking for a replacement screen! We took this to our vacation and we were able to charge everything at the same time.  No need to take multiple chargers.  Love it! So far so good.  The power cord is long enough that there isn't ever an issue with placement of a plug in.Every port seems to work just fine, charging at a fairly quick pace.  I think the &#34;PowerIQ&#34; technology works almost a little too well because it doesn't seem to charge my LG G2 quite as fast as a typical 2 amp plug , but it juices up my Galaxy Note 3 (which needs a full 2 amps to get charged in a reasonable time) extremely fast, as fast or faster than it's OEM plug.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase.I've been a big fan of Anker products.  Their products look very high quality and typically perform very well.  When they don't, their customer service is second to none, and that is what keeps me buying from them. This is an awesome product. Only wish it had some way to be attached to or stashed somewhere to lock it down. I used it on military duty and it works really well for me and everyone else with me. Since it charges all our phones big phones little phones at the same time!  Add some way to install this somewhere and it's perfect! I think this is one the best Anker products that I bought ( and I got 6 products from this brand) besides the 3 external backup batteries.The charging time is fast, I love it. Works just fine with my Note 3 for conductive charging. I travel for work quite a bit and this portable fold-stand is easy to pack and works great.  Has not let me down! The Price is OK. You get what you Pay for. So for $220 it's nice phone to have but, the OS or Graphics are not anywhere near to Samsung Android Phones. This looks like more Nexus kind of phone.Battery Runs out very fast. If you fully charge your Battery in Morning, by Night time it goes to 30 percent and that too without 3G or 4G or any data, When it's connected to wi-fi, (I meant connected not being used). May be use of 1 hour on talk. and connected to wi-fi will drain down the battery. So you can imagine the Battery life with 4Glte or 3G.Both the Speaker volume is too low. If you plan to use speakerphone on this, don't buy this. Speakerphone volume is too low. You can't even think of having it in car using hands free. And while talking on phone the voice is too low and sometimes you can't understand what the other person is talking even though they might be your family member whom do you know. or any stranger.The inbuilt Email application in android phones don't work with Yahoo Mail. You will have to manually refresh every time and even after that they will not be update. The case is good but it's holds your phone from 2 sides only. So if your phone falls down it can't save the top and bottom edge to get dent or break as the phone itself is simply made of plastic. So it's good for protecting the back and Front glass. Not the entire phone or all edges. It's nice in color and fit's perfectly on phone. The case itself is not scratch resistant. It makes scratches on the case itself even if it's kept on desk or any other surface. So it protects your front and back phone but don't protect edges of dent or break if it falls down and case itself from scratches. Cool little gadget. The batter lasts a surprisingly long time. I just don't like that the volume control uses the same buttons for song skip buttons. This phone is great. Can't take my hands off this The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is that sometimes when you put the case on people can't hear you on the phone so it takes a bit of adjusting and popping the case on and off several times to get the speaker and mic pieces just right so it doesn't sound like you're talking thru a tin can.  As far as the durability its definitely durable and waterproof as adverstised.  Great investment for those that need the protection. works great...charges multiple gadgets at once...phones, iPads or a tablet..would highly recommend Item brand new, in manufacture's package, unopened, unused. This model has always exceeded my expectations if you look at the prize you're paying for it. Cell phone works like charm. As it is brand new, there was no configuration other than the one I set it up. This Samsung Galaxy Light is very light indeed, but it's an awesome cell phone. It does everything you need from a cell phone except for Polaris App for reading Office documents is not intended for it. But this does not stop me from rating this cell phone with a five stars plus. I've owned one for more than a year and I've had no issues with it. Never had to reset it, or cell has never freezed like other Galaxy  and I bought this as a gift because I'm sure it's going to work great. I like this product QUALITY is key to this skin! its amazing and it gives the phone a whole new look ! LOVE it! This is your average silicone case. It fits the moto g like a glove and looks goods. I got the blue one. Very tight fit. No complaints. Good basic case. Minimal drop protection The high capacity SOLAR power bank is PERFECT for those high demand electronics - both during summer storm season, winter storm season and all those summer treks to the park, the beach, or the cabin where power is not as readily available.  Just remember it's solar, it will take longer to recharge, or you can manually recharge via USB.  Having worked in disaster work and been a road warrior, I find devices such as this invaluable - particularly solar models.  I keep several USB LED lamps handy - together they are a great emergency lighting system when the power goes out! Though I received the OXA external battery for reviewing purposes, it's been working great, I highly recommend! Good for the price. it fits good on my samsung galaxy s3.  It does hold charge but not that well it does its job. I gave it a 4 Because u get for wat u pay for after reading the reviews on this phone I decided to give this case a shot. first I tested it without my phone in the case like it reccomended and put it under water for 5 minutes. the case did get moisture inside. you definitely have to make sure you put it on correctly. I wouldn't trust this case to be used underwater, but as far as sand, rain, dirt & dropping it goes, I'd give this case a thumbs up Great, high quality product and wonderful customer service that stands behind their product. The Clear film is good. But the Matte finish is not good as Glossy one. It looks like your phone is too old if you use Matte Finish Screen Protector. They are not clear on the website about Clear or Matte. great screen protectors and exact size and fit Just what you need and nothing else. Can be a little slippery. The case and screen are tough enough on their own, but this just offers a little something extra and a little more peace of mind.I also use a magnetic mount in my truck and the metal plates that need to go inside the case fit very well and it holds to the mount really well. Sturdy case, beautiful color!! There is nothing to dislike about this case.So I recommend it because I can't find any flaws in it (and I am fairly good at finding flaws).As others have noticed, this case comes coated with two thin plastic films. You need to remove them if you want the most transparency.The outer edges protrude slightly to protect the screen. But I also think the level of protrusion is insufficient for more serious drops.Pros:1)Fits my Galaxy S5 perfectly2)Looks nice3)Thin profile4)Reasonably priced.Cons:1)You should remove the two thin film coating prior to use.2)In my opinion, the outer protrusion which protects the screen is not thick enough to protect the screen from more serious drops. great case and looks really good Great color. So glad I made the decision to get the red.  Been extremely happy. Over priced and doesn't work well have to download additional app to use camera. Not worth the price cannot see text message or answer phone when cover closed. It will not fit if you have a Element Case or other case that will cover the bottom of your phone, the lightning connector is thicker than OEM one Ok I wouldn't purchase again too thin!! Perfect fit for the phone and all accessories. Feel confident it will protect my phone and I really like the look/color. great fit and the installation accessories make installation a snap. Very thin!! Great little power block and it works as intended. I am now on full charge number 3 and I get several full recharges on my iphone 5s from it. As awesome as always. I look the iSmooth products for all the devices I have owned. These are amazing screen protectors!!!!  I had the HD from ISMOOTH and this one seems even more clear and perfect to the touch.  Just FOLLOW the DIRECTIONS and this is not a difficult install.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone! Like many of the non-Apple lightning charger cables, the tip of the lightning connector is bigger than your original Apple lightning charging cord.  As a result, it did not fit through my case. Make sure your case has a large opening for the charger; otherwise, you'll have to remove the case every time you want to charge it. This phone is a substantial improvement in features and speed over my S II.Can't find fault with the phone, except it appears there is an upgrade to the camera software, but I cannot find out how to get it. My camera has far fewer features than Samsungs e-mails to me show. Haven't had the opportunity to call tech support to see if it can be fixed. I bought this device months ago and I can't figure it out how it work... But right now it works very awesome... It's worth it...I just turn my Bluetooth on and scan the device and  &#34; Ta Da&#34; it made me grin for ear to ear... I love it to the moon and back... :-) Neat Little device, allows you to take pictures remotely.  Gives a whole new concept to selfies and allows you to place your phone remotely and take candid shots.  Low cost enough to keep it interesting.  I used it on an iPhone, didn't try it on an android type phone. I love that it's like a small purse, where I can carry my IDs, CC, Money and my cell phone is protected.  I just put it on my shoulder or cross over my chest and go! Embarrassingly, here is the list of phones that I've owned (that I can remember):Samsung Galaxy s5iPhone 5SSamsung Note 3Samsung Galaxy s4Blackberry BoldBlackberry CurveNokia E6Nokia X2iPhone 3GSiPhone 3GNokia 1100And many more that I can't remember.So I love Apple Computers, and the last decade has been marked by a love and hate relationship with the Apple ecosystem. I think the iPad is a great device (and I DON'T like the Galaxy line of tablets). I really enjoy MacBooks in all sizes and shapes. But the iPhone stopped evolving with the 3GS, and they are now playing catch up with Samsung.The s5 is the game changer. I have been using this phone for a month now and can, without hesitancy, say that this is the best phone on the market. In addition, it is actually cheaper than the iPhone 5S! The speed, the beautiful photography, the performance, the sound - everything is better. The iPhone 5S was a bit clunky and would sometimes randomly scroll on its own. This phone doesn't do that. It is seamless.STEVE JOBS would have preferred this phone.In addition to all the other additions, this phone is indestructable. It can withstand dust storms, rain storms, etc. I have to deal a lot of this as a development worker in Africa. This phone can take it all. Awesome buy, I love to the moon and back... The price is awesome...my friends are jealous they wanted one too for them...I'm gonna buy one again for my dearest friend for her birthday... :-)... Works well for my at&t Galaxy Note 3. No complaints. Better than those Nexus 7s that all failed on me. I really like this cover. I like the color and it fits great! I definitely would recommend this if you are like me and like pink Arrived on time, work, and seem to be very sturdily made. My only hope is they come out with a 2 foot model. Highly recommend. I've had this for a month now. My impressions overall are mixed and i dont really know what purpose it is trying to serve.It is not a photo manager as it says, there are barely any such tools to really manage the photos you put on it. The Apple version of the app has some basic stuff like deleting photos and such. But the desktop version i tried (windows 8) has no such thing to manage or even view the photos on the lyve! I do like the fact that it doesnt delete the pictures from the uploading device. There is no way to backup the lyve so you definitely dont want to put all your 'eggs in one basket' as they say. But i suppose this might be annoying for some.So then is it a pretty digital picture frame? I guess that sort of fits, but its a pretty steep price for a picture frame; especially one you have no control over what it shows. It just goes through all the pictures you have uploaded onto it. I dont understand why i cant specifically choose what pictures/ albums i want shown on the LCD screen. Am i the only one who has photos they want to store but not show everyone that comes over to my house? So no, i dont think it properly qualifies as a picture frame either. Though i do think the hardware is very good quality and yes , the LCD touchscreen is nice and pretty as well but for the price that should be expected in my opinion.So is this a storage device that collects your pictures automatically for you from your devices? This fits best... but even then its not very useful because it only supports the 'latest and greatest' smartphone systems ( atleast android 4.1/ iOS 7 ). Otherwise you still have to manually upload your pictures via USB and that defeats the whole 'automatic' thing. So in conclusion i think this is another product that fits the 'jack of all trades but master of none' category and honestly for the price and current feature set i personally wouldnt recommend it to anyone. This has been a great product for me so far because I have multiple computers and tablets filled with pictures and 2 GB of storage for this type of media is a LOT. There are armies of photos you want to keep around, too, and you really do not think of how easy it is to lose years of experiences simply by having some unfortunate calamity such as a crash. I like having something that is dedicated to my pictures, and it does feel good to have them in one easy-to-access place. It also felt good going through them, because there are armies of pictures I had forgotten about and it felt good seeing people who have since been lost or have grown up. I also like the idea of not having to pay to store my pictures on some digital service, because that gets expensive. They are worth it, sure, but monthly charges get old. Synching devices to this thing was really easy, and reviewing via a device is also pretty simple. I also like the idea of a digital frame, and I am not someone who thought they would ever type that.There are some downsides to this as well. For one, it would be nice to be able to go through and select pictures easily but this system is mainly a date search engine. The price is kind of high as well, and it takes FOREVER to load from your PC to the device. I think more control would be nice, period.All-in-all, a nice thing to have but read up on the downsides first to make an informed decision. If they sound good to you, you are picking up something that is nice to use and can make days or even weeks of reviewing extremely worthwhile. The Eachine Ultra-slim X3 charger makes me happy.  It's so light and compact, about the size of a cell phone, that you could tuck it into your pocket for emergency charges.  It has a smooth, sure-grip surface, and built in USB and Micro B plugs so that you never have to carry an extra cord for charging.  It also comes with three extra charging tips, a Mini B, an Apple, and a Nokia.It doesn't have the power that the bigger chargers do, it's good for one, maybe two short charges of my phone.  But it charges and recharges quickly.  The color of the case is quite wonderful, too. The Eachine 10400mAh is for all intents and purposes exactly the same as Eachine's 7800mAh battery... except more powerful and only a few bucks more.Both have several selling points: bright LCD backlit screen displaying current battery level and status, two USB outputs, and most importantly, an internal power regulating chip which prevents overcharging, overloading, short circuits, etc. The side flashlight function is bright enough for spotlight illumination in dark environments.The unit weighed at 8.7 ounces, and it has some heft to it. Not really something you will slip into a pocket, but certainly light enough for backpack traveling.  The rectangular shape also will fit nicely into large purses.  I have uploaded a photo of the 10400mAh pack next to a PSP 3000 so you can get a relative sense of size.The packaging instructions specifically state it is compatible with:Various lighting Apple Products (but use the original Apple Lightning to USB cable) as well as a specific 30 pin adaptor provided for iPhone 3, 4, and 4S, HTC Phones, Samsung Phones, Blackberry, Motorola, Nokia (comes with the specific DC2.0 connector), LG, Sony, Google Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX and other kindles, and others such as the Nook Tablet, Portable WiFi, and the PSP (NOT the PS Vita).Although not listed in the instructions, the on-site description does state that this power bank is NOT COMPATIBLE with The iPod Nano, Samsung and Asus tablets and a few other sundry GPS/Bluetooth devices. Which is unfortunate as I have a Samsung Tab 3, and yes, I tried... and no, it does not work reliably with the Tab 3. However, I cannot hit on that as it does specifically state that it isn't supported. I also tried it out on an iPod Nano, which did charge to full, yet the LCD screen did not register the discharge rate. So take note that the few categories it doesn't support, they apparently mean it.Now in reference in particular to the PSP, this power bank does not come with the requisite 5v adapter, but USB to 5v charging cables for the PSP are available here on Amazon and will work with this power bank. I bought aData & Power USB Cable for Sony PSPand used it with this battery pack like a charm even while playing games or video on it.  The pack charged up the PSP 300, which was completely dead, to full in about an hour with only 7% of it's juice.  Now I can play my power hungry Final Fantasy games with impunity!I also tested the power bank with a Portable Wi-Fi (Verizon Jetpack), a older Kindle Keyboard, both of which were recharged in a timely manner with the internal chip automatically stopping the power output when they were for all intents and purposes full.All in all, still a shame about my Samsung Tab 3 not being supported, yet this is an excellent battery.  And I have to honestly say why buy the 7800mAh model when for a few dollars more you can get this Clint Eastwood powerhouse! (I couldn't resist the pun.  :P  )-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.  If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask!  I will be more than happy to answer, or even do a YouTube video demonstration if possible of any particular aspect you would like clarification. I am fantastically impressed with all the chargers I've received from Eachine, but the X2 is everything I could hope for in a sturdy, all-around charging device.  While it's a bit bigger and heavier than the X4, it's miles ahead of it in terms of power.  It's charged my phone a dozen times, and my Kindle Fire at least twice on one full charge.  And while the charging time for the tablet isn't nearly as fast as a direct connection, on the A2 connector, it's fast enough to make me happy.  This is the charger I would take with me on a trip.The X2, like the other Eachine chargers I've tried, comes with a USB to Micro B cord and three extra connector tips, a Mini B, an Apple, and what I believe is a Nokia connector.  It has a bright, easy-to-read LED display that shows you the remaining charge and which output you're plugged into (There's a 5V 1.0A and a 5V 2.1A.  The latter is what I use to charge my Kindle Fire.)  The display is activated when you plug in a device, or when you press the button beside it.  Press and hold  turns it off.  Press twice turns on the bright LED flashlight located just above the input, or turns the flashlight back off.Clearly a lot of thought has gone into Eachine's chargers.  They're all well-designed and versatile, but the X2 is the real workhorse of the group.  Very impressive. Great USB Multiport Charger that works well for charging Apple products. I own a iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPhone. I can charge all three at the same time with excellent results and efficiency. This is a must have for those that own multiple Apple mobile products. Super clear protector, i have been using for a while now and it doesn't seem to be easily scatched or anything. Would defintely recommed to protect your surface 2. I was looking for backup batteries for my week long vacation. I consider myself a heavy user (YouTube, Reddit, Twitch, Netflix, etc.) and these have not let me down. It's pretty much impossible for me to not go through all 3 batteries before the night is over.Key things I'd like to point out that you may have missed elsewhere:- These batteries hold slightly LESS of a charge than the OEM battery. I'd say about 20% less.- These batteries charge faster than Samsung's OEM battery (about 3.5 - 4 hours avg for full charge vs Samsung's 7 - 8 hours).- NO NFC.- You can Qi charge these with the correct accessories.- You can charge the OEM battery with this charger.- NO added bulk This has been great. I use the CD mount in my Tacoma and the phone stays exactly where it is supposed to be. I haven't taken it off road yet, but I plan to soon. I have hit potholes/bumps that I was concerned would cause my phone to take a dive, but like I said - no problem.I used both metal plates inside the case on top of each other and the smiley face on the outside of the case of my Samsung S5. It works most of the time but sometimes it doesn't. The plugs do not fit, you have to force them and then not move them or they'll stop working. For something that took a month to receive, I don't think it was worth it. Very handy for commuters. I'm always connected. My husband jokes that the only time my iPhone is not on my person, is when I'm in the shower - and then it's only about 5 feet away. We currently commute together. I use my phone, mounted on my dash, as my GPS to get me to work and avoid traffic. That uses a lot of battery power, so I use that in the 2.1A port. My husband also uses GPS as he helps me as copilot when things get hairy - and he uses the 2.0A port. I usually have my iPad mini plugged in as well so it will be charged by the time I get to the office - it's using the 1A - because it's off and I'm not using it - so it's a slow trickle charge, basically. If it's on fumes, I'll flip them around so the iPad is on the 2.1. I like the tiny blue LED indicator that lets me know the charger is receiving power and is properly seated. I also like the minimalist design. It takes up very little room for a 3-port charger. Great idea, but too fragile and it just made the whole tablet experience awkward. The grip at the bottom to hold the tablet is too thin. The adjustable silver turn notches R cheap fake metal.. Couldn't even tighten it to keep the tablet in place. It just made it seem like my tablet was too heavy for it to handle... And, it was. My tablet did fall from this dock thing and I have a dent on two corners:( super great slim clase, love the colors and also it is very durable.  Would recommend! I got this case for my daughter, she loved it.  She loved the color and I love how it protects her expensive phone.  Great quality case! Targeted to seniors, this is a phone that is easy to use and has many appealing features for those living alone. Definitely playing to a retro vibe, it is a flip phone. Mine was an attractive candy apple red. The screens are bright and easy to read. Navigation was interactive with a request to confirm almost every action. For instance, if you wish to delete something, you are asked to push the yes or no button. There highly touted 5 Star button connects you to an agent who will determine whether emergency services are needed. There are fairly simple brain games included as well as a medication reminder and urgent care service that comes with some of the plans. Included is a a simple camera; however there is a .25 cent surcharge if you send or receive photos. The volume is good. I was especially pleased that the battery lasted a few days and did not need constant recharging. Voicemail set up was a snap and the caller id worked well. Customization options are limited but you can change the ring tone from that annoying jitterbug song.  A fairly thick but easy to follow manual accompanies the phone.Since my mother has been ill, we have been traversing the mountains to get her to medical appointments. The area is rural and cell service is sketchy. I was interested in getting a no contract phone for emergency use only. I purchased a Samsung Centura Tracfone but the touch screen was a challenge for arthritic hands and the array of smart phone features went unused. This phone was easy for her to understand and use. It is essentially a phone for people who want to make calls. As far as the 5 star service goes they seem to be reliable and fast. A friend's child was playing games on the phone and accidentally hit the button and hung up. The 5 Star service immediately called back to see if we were safe.Many of the safety features, i.e. check in calls, medication reminders and the like, are ideal for older people living alone. As my mother does not get cell reception in her house, they are of limited to use to her. However, the plans are pricey considering that many of the added features may be used occasionally if at all.This is a good basic phone. It is attractive in appearance and is easy to use. Not every one needs or wants a smart phone. With its retro vibe and simple to use features, it is worth consideration by non-technically inclined seniors. This phone is certainly a blast from the past.  It&#8217;s definitely a flip phone.  I found one of a similar make in the children&#8217;s toy box.  The old one is silver and has smaller keys though.  One of the things that I liked about those phones was that they were a lot harder to make butt calls from.  The bright red coloring makes it much easier to find when it is sitting on a desk or out on any surface, like my kitchen counter, which is grey tile.I had a few medical questions that I often forget to ask my doctor or that I can&#8217;t ask because I am not the one who takes the relevant child in, so I did think this service could be useful.  For me though, from the time the first operator answered the phone and said she was sending emergency services, all of that was just too much for me.  And really, in retrospect, where were they going to send emergency services?  So, yes, they did start asking a lot of questions but I wanted to ask the questions.  It began to feel very intrusive, before I could even speak to a nurse.My husband often has questions that he doesn&#8217;t want to email his doctor about and I thought he might be willing to talk to the people on this service &#8211; and in fact it would be well worth the monthly cost.  However, his health problems are complex enough he thinks he should just email his own doctor&#8217;s office.  I&#8217;m like, &#8220;But you don&#8217;t.&#8221;The expense of this service would make it worthwhile if someone were able to use the phone service.  I can see a lot of situations where it would be useful.DON&#8217;T get this phone for the games.  LOL! I have replaced so many phones and paid so much money replacing my screen because I'm clumsy when it comes to my phone.  I can not begin to brag how great this screen protector has worked.  I have dropped my phone a few times since I placed the screen protector on my iPhone and nothing, not even a scratch on my phone.  Highly recommend this to anyone, especially the clumsy like me! Love the size of it, which fits nicely in your pocket.  Only con is that it doesn't hold that large of a charge at only 3200 mAh.  We have a larger one at 11,000mAh and it can charge my ipad or iphone in about an hour quicker.  This one takes probably 2 hrs to charge an iphone then it's dead.  But good thing is, it doesn't take too long to recharge, we just plug it into our iphone square box, and plug it into the wall.  Pretty soon it's ready to go again.  Or you can plug it into your computer to recharge (with a cord they give you - to recharge it).  You use your iphone cord to plug it into your smartphone/tablet.  If you want a small size and cheap price - this is a good product.  Just don't expect much power. Doesn't work all the time, purchased as a back up. And it doesn't work with the samsung charger, super clear protector, have not gotten a scratch on this protector at all. These are a great, great buy! 2 for under $10 that work really well and iTunes recognized when you hook your phone to the computer is the true test for me. Also they seem very similar to the original even though they are aftermarket. This was a great deal for anyone needing a replacement set of charging cables for ipad or iPhone! Great product! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  These are very nice cables, much better than other generics.  They work as advertised with my iPad. I feel like these will last me for the life of my device. Exactly what I was looking for! You can feel the quality when you first open up the package. Not cheep junk. Works the first time every time, built to last. Thanks! Years ago, when I began my search for a Bluetooth headset I had some specific criteria that has provided to be difficult to fulfill.  Prior to the purchase of the BackBeat FIT headset I've purchased several other brands of various design.All have had their short-comings.  In one area these do, too.  In a noisy environment they do not seal in my ear well enough to overcome the ambient noise regardless of the volume set.  Also, because of the poor seal the bass response is nearly nonexistent.  In a less noisy environment they sound very good although, I'm left wishing for better bass.  If there were a way to improve the seal I'd have no complaints.  My spouse (smaller ears) does not share the same complaint in regard to the seal.  Should you be fortunate enough to have the proper design ear canal you'll be very happy with the comfort and seal of these.My main hope with these were a great improvement in battery life.  No disappoints here.  Depending on the media you can easily obtain the promised run-times.  For instance, audio books will play much longer than highly driven music.  It helps to have the volume on your music player high and adjust the volume on the FIT to your preference.I have a set of Plantronics BackBeat Go 2's to compare.  For me those are perfect except in the run-time department.  If you'd like to save some money I recommend the 2's over the Fits, if you can live with the battery life and troublesome fit some have reported.The Fit's have the most impressive Blue Tooth range of any wireless headset I've ever used.  It really is surprising better.Call quality is very good both receiving and transmitting.  No complaints from any callers at all on either end.They are also very secure.  If these things come out during the normal course of your activities I suspect you'd also be on the way to a hospital.I consider these to be Plantronics best effort and recommend them I&#8217;ve been sadly behind the times when it comes to wireless headphones for a few reasons: my inner ear is a weird shape that doesn&#8217;t fit well with ear buds, and I have big ears. This means that earbuds fall out of my ears and I have a headache after wearing headphones. The Backbeat FIT are the first headphones that stayed on my head and didn&#8217;t hurt.There&#8217;s so many things these headphones get right. They&#8217;re light. They adjust to your ears, bending so that they fit perfectly.  They&#8217;re so light that I don&#8217;t notice they&#8217;re on.  And the stereo quality is fantastic &#8211; at least to me, but I&#8217;m no audio expert.There are a few flaws, one being the buttons.  You might think that you would turn the headphones on and off by pressing the button on the center of the headphones.  You would be wrong &#8211; you actually press the raised edge of one of the buttons. Also, it&#8217;s a bright &#8220;alien goo&#8221; green, but this is really for folks who want to be seen from a distance when the jog (I run on a treadmill).Even the case is awesome.  It turns inside out to be a container for the headphones as well as the charger, and straps neatly around your bicep or leg to hold your iPod.  If you buy one set of headphones, these will do nicely. This is such a cool little product!  My kids like to use this to take selfies on my phone.  Very easy to use, if my 8 year old figured it, anyone can. I got this for my husband, it' s a great case, it's clear and has not broken or fall apart.  So far so good, great case! I found this screen protector just as easy to install as advertised. No bubbles. No tricky positioning. It just went right on smoothly and easily.One thing I appreciate about this protector is the texture it offers my phone's screen. It's not slick, it's not rough, but it has a smooth feel under my fingers that I find to be an improvement over the feel of the glass itself.One thing I don't appreciate (and this is admittedly a very minor gripe) is the slight edge the protector creates around my home button. If I didn't have a 5S I probably wouldn't mind, but using the touch-id with this protector on isn't as pleasant on the fingertips as using touch-id without it. Well constructed, very convenient  and easy to use. I love it. I'm going to order one for my son. I highly recommend this product..(it permanently replaced my previous one) When I ordered this it was to be for my daughter as she has the iPhone 5c but to my surprise my iPhone 4s fit in it very nicely so I'm keeping it for myself. It's really nice and better than I expected. It's a really nice, quality fabric that seems as if it will hold up to a lot of wear and tear. The band has Velcro so it's adjustable and fits my arm nicely and really stays in place. The fabric has a slight give, like it has a little stretchability, which I think adds to the comfort factor; I hardly know it's there. The clear plastic front does not effect the touch screen ability at all which is surprising and nice.  For the safety aspect, there is a grey reflective stripe around the front screen area and around the Velcro area in the back...very smart. I am very happy and look forward to many walks and bike rides with my phone safely on my arm. Love the key holder! Wow, this is a nice iPhone armband.  I ordered it so I could job and still have my phone with me.  It is everything I hoped it would be. It is lightweight and does not make my arm sweat.  It stays where I put it and does not slide down my arm.  My phone fits in it perfectly and it also has a key holder.  I highly recommend this product. This is a great back up for my phone. I am not having to take my cord in and out of the house and most the time I leave it in the car and then need to go back out or I leave it home and my phone dies on me. This thing really is fast. Plugged my iPad air and wow, was charged fully after only a short time. It's great to have this as an extra . This cable is a high quality product. Works great. It comes in a nice package. It's a little longer than my other cable which is something that I have been looking for.. Overall great product . Works well. Great value This is a nice quality cable. It works perfectly with my iPhone. Hooks up to my phone with ease.  I highly recommend it. I got this for my company cell phone.  It is a really nice case. It is a made very well and is a  quality case that has a nice rubber cover and then a hard protector outer case. It is really attractive on my phone and I am very happy with it.  I feel my phone will really be protected with this case. What a high quality cable. Right out of the pack you can tell that this is not your cheap, replacement ipod/iphone cable.  This thing has substance! It also holds well while connected and doesn't fall out..I have had that problem with some aftermarket charging cables.  This is really one of the nicest cables I have every seen.  Great buy for sure! I originally got this for my hubby but he has the 5s, so this particular cord isn't supported for the phone. Luckily I have the first 5 I-phone and worked for mine. Although there is the error message that &#34;this device isn't supported.&#34; Something along those lines. Not exact words. It won't work!!!! Absolutely love these headphones. Great for music, great for phone conversation. So awesome I left my coworker hear them and he bought mine for double the price... then I bought two more, one for me and one for my dad. I use it all the time.  The battery lasts a few hours.  Only occasionally do I have Bluetooth re-connect issues.  I do wish the buttons were easier to see though. Very durable.  I wish my wife would have had this on her phone before she broke it and had to pay for another one. perfect product! Great value - I've owned Otterboxes and other much more expensive cellphone cases and this one does as good a job as the others at a fraction of the cost. I purchased one about a year and half ago and it's still a good case. Love the size and love the fact that both my husband and I can charge both his IPHONE and my Galaxy S5. Although this case may be huge, it protects your phone. We bought this to cover our phone while at the water park. It did its job fabulously! My husband accidentally dropped the phone in the lazy river, it was submerged for over 20 min in 3 feet of water, and the phone survived! I probably wouldn't recommend this cover for everyday use, as hearing isn't so easy. If you need to protect your phone while still having access to the camera, videos, texting and social media, then this is the cover for you! It protects my phone very well and I love the color! great silicon case.  pretty clear, fits well, nice texture.  happy with it, if it fades in the coming months ill just order another Nice case. Works well and as noted. Stood the tablet at a good angle for viewing movies et on my train/plan trips. It wouldn't be very good if you wanted to type etc as it wouldn't be stable enough for that. Took me twice to put it in and get it adjusted right, but it works great. After numerous inquiries over 2 months, product never came.email apologies and promises of sending out a replacement, but nothing.Just as well, as the Laza Zcell extended battery I purchased ended up solving the loose usb charging port on the galaxy note anyway, which is much easier than taking the phone apart for this.maybe the back cover included with the Laza is the solution? Not sure. But all is good now. And great battery life, over 1.5 days between charges. used to be 7 hours or so before dead. This one looks like the mold was off the bottom has a bit too thick a lip, while the top is a bit too thin. Maybe i should exchange it...Bummer because i have one also for a Note 3 which was perfect... Fits my 10 inch Tab 4 like a glove and very good material. great price and product for Galaxy S4. Took 2 tries to put this on, and finally got it on the 3rd one.  Good thing they send a 3 pack.  Almost impossible to get on without a dust bubble or any bubble.  I think it was a waist of my money to be honest with you.  Would rather buy it from a store and have them put it on. Does its job.  Best to let someone who knows how to put protector on do it. Took 2 tries, but got it on.  Maybe not the easiest, but will work for now. product is good. worth the purchased. These screen protector are awesome I love these bumpers.  I use a black one with a faux leather battery cover and the white one with a white battery cover and they both look awesome and I switch when I get bored I love this phone so much that I can't wait to get the HTC One M8!  The only thing I would change is that I would have liked to get the Google Play Edition. This review gets 2 stars for 1 reason only.The note 3 protectors, No complaints.But the gear protectors are a joke!!!!!!!!! Anyone who has a gear watch knows the whole face is made of glass. These protectors were little cut out squares that would go in the middle of the glass and cover just the screen part that lights up and black when off. What the?? That's just retarded. It needs to cover the WHOLE surface area of the glass or else what's the point?? It will fall off easy and doesn't provide full protection.  Went into trash.... This is not my first otterbox, but it is the first one I regret purchasing. The glacier case is pretty ugly in person, and makes my white phone look clunky and cheap instead of sleek like I expected. Also, the silicon pickers at the top whenever the head phone port flap is closed. That being said, this case has done it's job and protected my phone from my baby so far. beautiful leather and easy to use. I was a little geeked out to get one of these for my birthday. I'm tired of having my phone sitting in my cupholder or flailing around my front seat. Too bad the bendy arm that connects the neck to the cigarette adapter base broke 4 hours after I installed this. Could be a defective unit, could be I'm stronger than I realize. But either way, buyer beware. Was a nice case and lasted a very long time. Very nice quality battery So ill probably need to update my original review for my husbands ( he got the one for the S3 in blue), but these are simply not worth the money! The band on both of ours ripped right at the seam where the Velcro starts. I emailed the company and they were gracious enough to not only refund our money but send new arm bands and sent extension straps. Well those ripped as well in the same darn place! 4 bands all ripped the same exact way in a matter of weeks.Yes we used them 5-7 days a week but i really think that Gear Beast needs to go back to the drawing board on this one. It wasn't worth the time or hassle and I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. The Premium Ballistic Glass is great.  I first bought the regular Tech Armor plastic screen protector but decided to upgrade.  It was well worth it.  The screen feels easier to use and does leave as much fingerprints.  It's real easy to put on.  No bubbles at all.  I guess that's why they didn't include 3 protectors like they do with the regular plastic protectors.  Now I'm buying one for my IPad Mini. Easy to install, and you can't even tell there is a screen protector on my phone. Customer service is great. There are 2 raised home button stickers included. This cover works perfectly with my otter to protect my phone from my 1 year old Its ok just not very durable. Love it This case is a very good buy. I provides good protection for my phone and it's also very stylish. I'm glad I purchased it! Not happy with this one as it uses a &#34;patch&#34; adapter for the iphone 5 (as stated) that just does not plug in with out holding it, and that is just NOT what you want to do driving.  The power unit is most likely good but the adapter seems to fall out or loose connection.  Verizon generally makes good quality products.  I think it just was a bad idea to put an adapter to a Lighting connector.  Apple products can be so touchy in this area! It was cute and colorful. I liked it.. Protected the phone very nicely and had a cute pattern Nice looking case but the quality is poor.  I placed it on my s4 and the bottom left corner will not snap down.  There is also a lump on the flip cover right below the window and it appears there is a piece of plastic stuck in the material so I am returning it because it looks terrible.  It is a shame because the case does not look too bad but the quality is too poor.  The corners are also rough, this case is a big NO. Perfect! I like it. Arrived earlier than expected. .. a gift for someone facing several hour bus rides on a regular basis- when his phone inevitably died-  this charger allows extended use, recharges quickly, functions as promised... no more carrying charger cords and plugs and maybe losing them... no more borrowing chargers... he's got it covered with this easily portable unit! Perfect fit, holds a charge fairly well, lasts longer than the aging OEM battery I took out, but not quite as long as a new OEM battery. Loved this case. The buttons were hard to press but other than that it was the nicest case and for a good price I like this case. It doesn't give it a ton of protection but the ones that do are bulky. This slides easily into my pocket or purse.As said the buttons seem stiff but you get use to it. I thought I had to push really hard but you don't. It just doesn't feel like you are pushing enough but you are. Not a big enough issue to keep me from buying one again.Love the black and white. Very sharp. Fits great, good front-edge protection, has cutout for the &#34;M&#34; logo, and buttons are still easy to press. Came cracked, don't waste your time and money with this stuff online. By the time it gets to you theirs a 85% chance it'll be cracked. A little bulky, but with a lot of reserved power!  The battery pack is well made and looks great! Even if it's bulky and doesn't have a LED flashlight, like my other battery packs, I still give it 5 stars!  I bought it as an external battery pack and it charges quickly, and in several cycles.  Great buy! Studs fell off way too easy. in 2 days is work very well, so now i love it, its charge my iphone 5s two times :) i love it now... This case is not for protecting your phone from drops, but thats not what I ordered it for. I ordered it to protect my phone from scratches and to give it a unique look. I love the look and it is very slim, so barely changes the size of my phone. Works as indicated. Only problem is that phone overheats if it is sunny. These sunglasses are a very good buy. They are well made and also very stylish. They allow me talk or listen to music while drive, jog, etc. I'm glad I purchased them! Hands down one of THE BEST cases you can get for your black iPhone 5 or 5s. It's durable, slim, and good looking. I've dropped my phone a few times with this case on and the case still looks great. My phone is still in perfect condition. The only downside is that they sell the frames for such a high price on their own. This battery did not fit my Samsung S4 frorm Verizon.  Way too big!  Also had a date on it of 2013 (fyi) I have had this case on my phone for several months and I am satisfied with it. Only a few slight scratches on the painted surface so far but it has delivered the expected protection for my phone. Wow lately Spigen has been disappointing at every turn and this case just adds to it's downfall.I used to be a huge Spigen fan and always recommended their cases and screen protectors but lately all I have are issues with the protectors and the cases and this one so far is the worst.Here's what I like:It's like a sophisticated otterbox case for your note 3 that will protect your phone from falls, even those nasty corner drops.-The s view does work but it lags and you may need to apply a bit of pressure.-Case is actually assembled in 2 parts so you can remove the door and the plastic that holds it together to have a silicone cases that is not too shabby-Camera hole is the perfect shape and does not allow surfaces to touch so the lens is always protectedWhat I hate:-Your phone will be protected but the case will not survive the falls especially the door bc its made out of cheap plastic-The s pen is a pain to get out-The headphone is not easy to access-You have to remove your phones original back to use this case (otherwise s view will not work)-The s view windows does not always work and may at times cause your phone to be stuck on s view lock screen mode-The door hinge is poorly made and will not last long-Since the case is assembled in two parts, expect the plastic portion to break-The door does not open as easily as you would expect-The s view door home button sticks (it will turn on many times when its in your pockets)-Matte finish so fingerprints and smudges will remain and give off a wear and tear look within months (gloss always leaves fingerprints but its easy to wipe off)I preordered this case and it took a while before I got it due to supply issues but when I received I was very happy and pleased. Unfortunately that did not last. The part of the case that holds the door and the hinge together snapped off and essentially the case came apart.Luckily for me Spigen announced that they would cover this cases for an extra 2 years or so with their new cases and I was told on twitter that it also applied to their past cases (I forget exact coverage years). I was able to get a replacement by sending them photos via twitter and email and I honestly expected to get brand new case but no. What I got was a replacement door. I contacted them again and sent them better photos and told them that the door is not the only thing broken. They apologized and sent me the plastic cover that holds the hinge and door and goes over the silicone portion of the case. At this point I just gave up and used what they gave me since it worked...for a month.That same plastic part of the case broke and the door continues to pop out now but they have not responded to my twitter complaints and frankly I am tired of their slow service so a negative review it is.I have never dropped my phone, banged it or let if take any damage. All I do is put it in my front pocket and attach it to my car dock that is all and yet the case does not last. Best darn case in the world. Amazing wireless charger and works with many different cases.  Only thing I dislike is if the phones sound is on or vibrate is on it stops charging when full then immediately connects again making noise each time. Sucks when you're trying to sleep. I like the charging base but the coil insert that needs to go into the phone causes warning alerts on my Galaxy S5 that the case is not closed properly and must be to be water and dust resistant. It's really thin and I thought it would work but it does cause a small bulge because I can tell that the case is tighter as well. I think the only option will to pay another $30 for the official Samsung case with the coil built in. It does charge a bit slower but since I leave it on the night stand overnight that is not an issue. I do not notice that the phone gets as hot as others have noted but I am feeling the case cover, not the back of the phone. I did notice that the Samsung cover is a little discolored after using this for one night so heat might be the cause. With it in a case, maybe the phone and cover itself are getting even hotter than I can feel from the external case. I like the concept so I am going to keep the charging base but buy Samsung's Qi cover instead and not use the card insert that was supplied with it. Also, with time the batteries tend to expand and bulge and I fear this will become a major issue sticking an additional card in there between the battery and sealed case. give one away to whomever needs one.I tell them &#34;here, choose a color&#34; and I see them using it all the time.Seniors like lanyard on phones. House and car keys too. Decent screen protector, but you could buy a glass one that would work better for about the same price. Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes. This wireless charging feature is a plus, I use it to charge my phone and tablets when I'm in the car. I would definitely purchase this again as well as try other products that Poweradd makes in the future for my all next future cell phones. This is a Go. It's a good case that seems to have decent protection.  And the kickstand has come in handy a few times.  But I knocked off 2 stars because of the holster.  I can't use it at all.  The belt clip is too small to fit around my 1 3/4&#34; belt. Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes.It just overheats my phone a lot. But other than that this is a Go. Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes. This wireless charging feature is a plus, I use it to charge my phone and tablets when I'm in the car.  I would definitely purchase this again as well as try other products that Ravpower makes in the future for my all next future cell phones. This is a Go. I love it Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes. This is very small to take when your traveling or at work. I would definitely purchase this again as well as try other products that Anker makes in the future for my all next future cell phones, tablets and other electronics. This is a Go. A very good community charger for the family. When only one device is connected, it charges FAST. Can charge multiple devices in parallel. It is beautiful yes and an awesome handy cover for my phone but I have a Samsung s3and it doesn't exactly fit the phone. I absolutely CANNOT use my volume button as it is partially blocked and every I shut the phone down at night I have to take it out of the cover or it puts i in safe mode and that causes a major problem my phone. Other than that it is.  A pretty cover. This is a Great Backup supply for your electronics.  You can use it with any electronics that has a USB charging cable.  I think the LCD remaining battery life display is an absolutely brilliant and handy feature.  It's so great to see how much juice is left in the device.  Or...if you haven't used it in awhile, check to see if it's even got any juice in it.  It holds power well.  I've grabbed it after weeks of no use to check it and find out it's still fully charged.  It dispenses power to my iPhone 5S and iPads well too.  It's a great size and shape.  Easy to use.  Very reliable.  Holds charge well.  Has enough juice to keep all my electronics with a good amount of power.  It's very handy and very useful.  It's becoming a must have in my household.  It's perfect to use if you're on the go, can't stop to charge the phone, yet out of juice in the phone.  Now you can recharge on the go.  Brilliant.I would definitely recommend this item. I received one of these back in February for free and totally forgot to review it.  That turns out to be a good thing.  I have many external battery packs.  I also use them heavily.Turns out that this one is my favorite and I did not even realize it.  This is the one I use on a daily basis.It is easy to use and charges overnight.  It has everything clearly marked.  Unlike some chargers where you have to guess this one is very clear and easy to use.Here is the part that matters.  This one has been in constant usage since then.  Charge and discharge over many months.......result.  It continues to function 100%.From an appearance standpoint this is the best and I think that is why I was using it.....it is a nice solid black color.  Looks nice when you need it.....small yet powerful. I am very impressed with this phone's features for the price. It is fast to respond to touch, it has Windows Phone 8, and all the features that go along with that OS, and it's cost is very affordable. I bought this to use as my work phone because what they issued me is junk (olllllddddd blackberry), and am very happy with my purchase. The only bad thing I can say about it is the back cover comes off a little easier than I would care for. Overall a great case for someone looking for a full-time case that offers good corner and front-face protection.  It fits and looks really nice, there's no play or movement, it just becomes part of the phone. It can be a little difficult to remove, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone who switches cases frequently.Nearly the perfect case for a moto X.  I'd love to give this 4.5 stars if I could, but there's just a couple things keeping it from being perfect:- Buttons are fairly stiff, even after a few months of break-in.- The edges are a bit sharp along the front/back mold joint line, and feel harsh against the hand.The material is a flexible TPU plastic that's a bit stiffer than most TPU cases, which I really like. There's no sticky feeling to the case; it adds just enough grip while still being easy to remove from a pocket. This case is kind of bulky and is sort of like a mock otter box. It has a rubber black part with a harder outer shell. I like how it can hold some cards and a few bucks so I don't need a purse when I go out. But I don't like how the case sticks out so far. My case was teal colored and the camera is set so far into the case that when I try to take pictures all of them are teal tinted because thats all the camera sees. But that is the only downfall. This case is like the picture it has nice followers and it's really cute but it doesn't fix the corners , and I'm not happy , money badly spent Got this for a present. He wanted something small enough to be able to carry around but would last. The controls are easy to understand and light shows how much charge is left.Build quality was good with a plastic body. Sounds quality with the wired or the Bluetooth is superb. The wiring is wierd with one side too short and the other too long. You can't adjust. Tangles easily. I wouldn't buy again considering above and the price. Would live with the process for a better wiring  and design. Works perfectly I didn't like it all it was very difficult to put on and then I can barely tape the screen with the case being on. I really wish I haven't bought it I will not be buying from this seller again. Great case for your bright red Nexus 5!  The color is spot on to the bright red color of the Nexus 5, and it looks like it was made by Google.  Be aware that the case does not have full on protection.  It doesn't cover the whole phone and sides because it's not meant to be like a Spigen case.  It's meant to make the Nexus 5 sleek and offer some protection.  I still give it a 5 stars because of the color match and the beautiful feel and look of the product. Well, done! Great price for protectors that work and stay on your phone for awhile. No case is perfect, this is probably one of the best you can get.Pressure from the bottom flap covering the charger port may actually cause the solder joints to loosen from the PCBoard of your phone requiring repair. This actually happens on my Note 2, so you better be careful with any case with covers.This case actually offers good protection, is a little slippery than the Aegis, but is well worth buying in my opinion compared to a lot of other ones that I have seen. Nice case - a little &#34;stuff&#34; in working buttons and/or pulling the stylus out of the bottom of the note 3. But it's a good, inexpensive case that really protects the device well. The stand has come in handy many times too! My boyfriend and I purchased this for his little sister because I'm giving her my iTouch for her birthday. It came in the mail in a good amount of time and seems very sturdy. We ordered it in purple (her favorite color) and the color is nice and bright. I like the clip option so she can clip it on her pants if we go to the store or on a road trip. We like the double case idea also because she is a bit clutzy ( like most 9 year olds) and if she drops it or splashes something on it, it won't be harmed.  I think she'll be really happy with it. We are. I LOVE this and I use it everyday.  I use this for my tablet In the living room (cup holder in the couch), In the theater/Game room (cup holder in the recliner), in the RV.  I am seriously thinking of getting a second one. The only change I would make is I wish the height was adjustable. Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes. I looked on youtube for a good QI charger as well as a slim one and purchased this. I have a Galaxy S5 it overheats to my phone above 45c and contacted the seller and had no response. I purchaes this for my son and he loves it. Love love love this screen protector, however on the sides it's a little to short for the case that i have. I'm not sure if it's just me but same corners are not flush and have that distorted look like it's going to come up.what all that being said, where it counts it's fantastic and i know i don't have to worry. Texting, playing games whatever fingers slide across the screen like butter. Saved my phone, but there was a small tear in the left side of the silicone since I got it, not big enough to cause problems, but mazel may be selling open boxes. I really like this car charger dock.  The grip fits my LG G2 very well and charges without fail.  I'm using the vent-clip adapter.While I really like the product, I do have an issue with the mount shaking quite a bit while I'm driving.  I have a small car with fairly tight suspension, so I feel bumpy roads more than some.  However, I think the vent-clip portion of the mount could probably use some improvement by giving it a lower clip with which to grab the vent in addition to the upper clip.  As it is, if I'm on a bumpy road the phone is shaking so much I can barely make out what's on the screen, let alone actually read anything.  My phone fell out once because I had it vertical rather than tilted back a bit. (no harm done, but it was a little unnerving.)  Since tilting it back, though, it has held the phone quite solidly.The electronics portion of the product works very well.  I appreciate that they included a short and a long micro USB cable, and I like the dual-color LED showing whether the unit is charging or not.  Other than my one complaint, I feel the product provides a very good value for the price. Works great! Great product love the color and price. But it overheats my phone. Contacted Powerbot to see if I could get a replacement and have not heard from them at all. Amazing for such a small speaker! I am very fussy about sound quality of my electronic devices. I am the kind of guy who will decide to buy/not buy a car partly based upon the quality of the audio system it comes with. So when I say that this little speaker will easily fill a small to med room with full range, crystal clear, high quality sound, trust me, it will. The unit is also beautifully designed, manufactured, and packaged. It took all of about 30 sec to pair it with my iPhone 5. This is my second Jabra product, and I have nothing but great things to say. This case is amazingly durable.  I ordered it after my niece leaped on to me and accidently kicked my phone off of my hip (with a belt clip) causing the phone to hit the ground and separating the screen and adhesive from the face of the phone just a bit.  The phone operates perfectly but the incident got me thinking about the cost of the phone and how much cheaper it is to simply have a great case.  My dad has the same case for his GS5 and he really likes the durability of the phone as well.  All things considered, I decided to make the move and order the phone from Amazon and had the case 2 days later (I have Amazon Prime and love it too)!  I have since dropped the phone but not worried about the impact because of the Otterbox protection.  It is great.  I may get another case just to have another color. 6 months down the road. Very scratched up and super smudgy. I recently moved on to a tempered glass protector with a good oleophobic coatiing. WAAAAYYYY better than this. (FYI, I got the Archshield Crystal Clear, very nice!) Purchased for my 6 year old grandson who inherited my old phone to play games on.  He loves the bright green color ... for the price it is a nice case but I am still unsure of how much the device will be protected by the case.  Great value for the price paid. This is my second Anker spare battery.  I bought the first one for my last Note and it worked flawlessly.  I couldn't really discern any difference in it's longevity per charge vs the OEM battery.  I think their quote of 500+ cycles for life is accurate because I had the last one for a year and half and it was only towards the end of that time that I thought I noticed a slight reduction in how long it would last.  Overall a great value and small price to pay for the convenience if you own a galaxy. Great battery. Used replacement Anker batteries for my S4 and note 3.Reliable batteries and no difference between the oem battery and ankers.This 6400mah battery is double than stock battery. Case is where the issue lies.There is no protection here so before you purchase know the case offers no protection for your phone. Definitely not 16W - more like somewhere between 5 and 8, but does charge my phone in full sun at a reasonable rate.  The Anker 14W foldable charges my phone about twice as fast in the same glorious southern california sun. This weighs a little less and has smaller dimensions so I'll take this backpacking instead.  I do wish it put out more than 1/3 its declared wattage though... Functional product, but nowhere near it's claim as far as output.Also, this only has one usb port, which is on the end of a pigtail, while the anker actually has a box with 2 ports to plug in to - with a more solid feel. Very difficult to apply.  I followed all the directions and applied in a clean area with clean hands yet it still had collected tons of particles underneath the screen protector when I got it on.  Had to throw away after 5 minutes. simple item fits the rubber case fine and the silver color is nice. beats the rest, hands down.... Very solid case.  I have only been using it for 2 weeks, but feels sturdy and well built.  Materials doesn't feel cheap.  Would recommend for the price. Cable is very thick - but otherwise, ok. Ended up ripping out my usb3 connector end on 3 different cables, all within 1 month of each other (after about 5 months of use). Disappointed in that.Also - doesn't fit in the bottom of my Evercase Offroad Dual Layer case. Have to peel it away to get this in. I like it. The 2 ports are handy and it works with lightning devices. The different colors are cool too so you can match your interior accents. It charges the phone, but nothing FAST about this charger. It does the job. Nothing fancy here just a charge cable I love the rugged and waterproof aspect of my Limefuel. I backed the project on Kickstarter and don't regret it at all. Love these cases and the colors! I was worried that since the price was so good the quality might not be but I was pleasantly surprised when I got them. They fit great and the screen protectors that came with it are nice and clear. I recommend these cases to anyone who like to have their phone match what they wear everyday like me (: Its REALLY nice.I like how its ONLY glossy around the front of the case, it makes it look nice.Then the rest is a Matte Black finish. REALLY nice.A lot better than my old Spigen case, sorry!Especially how cheap it was!I love it! Even my dad, who has a iPhone 5s with a leather case from Apple says its nice and he likes the feeling.The contours of the case feel like the phone it's self, and it has that matte black.Also the shipping was quick!All-in-All amazing case. Glad I bought this! Good great price Took this with me the past weekend on a roadtrip from Boston to NYC. It was mainly used for charging of my freedompop hotspot and my wife's iphone5s. It served us well the whole trip. We never ran out of juices. I brought a power bank with me and thought I would need it. Turned out I didn't bother using the powerbank at all because whenever we were in the car, we could charge ourselves quickly and conveniently. My car has 2 power outlets. In the past I had to use each outlet for each device's charging service. Now I can use one outlet to charge and the other outlet is free for my other guests in the car. I love it. It also has light which looks very cool at night. I bought this based on all the positive reviews, but unfortunately the one I received doesn't work in either port.  Very disappointing.. Great product with cool blue led light. looks very modern and high tech in your car charger. cables fit snug without being overly tight or too loose. best part is i can charge my iPad in the car. My car already has usb ports in it but are not strong enough to charge an iPad. Its nice that the latest updated version has labeled ports so you know what you can charge in each port. The Trentium, Apple iPhone 5S Rugged case with 3 color interchangeable covers, is the ideal solution for those users who put their phone in harm&#8217;s way throughout the course of their day or are just plain accident prone. With the added protection of this case the phone also benefits from protection against water and dust. I feel this case would particularly benefit first responders (fire, police, EMT, etc.), construction workers, on-the-go professionals such as sales people, technicians, etc.The case fits &#8220;like a glove&#8221;, is easy to remove and install, does not drastically increase the thickness of the unit, the 3 color (black, gold and silver) interchangeable covers are a nice touch giving you appearance options and the built in screen protector is the protection clincher for me. I can finally say that for the first time I feel as safe as possible with a good looking case for my 5s! The NT630CR is a delightful case providing virtually everything one could wish for in an iPhone case.  It is incredibly lightweight, durable (essentially a trademark of every New Trent product), and functional.  The screen-cover works wonderfully well- it is protective while at the same time allowing full range of touch motions to operate the touch screen.  There is no other product on the market quite like this.  Competitors, like Otter Box, make a similar case but way too large.  Apple worked hard on making the iPhone 5/s thin and lightweight, and so this product is the first of it's kind that seems to respect Apple's design, and appreciate the consumer's preference. Why buy an iPhone only to attach such a gigantic case.Also a great decision by New Trent is the exterior feel of the material encasing the phone - it is a slip-resistant material- which actually improves upon the iPhone itself, which is polished metal and glass which can slip pretty easily particularly when in dry hands.Finally, the style options are a fun &#34;extra.&#34;  While I'm not personally big on style, many are, as apple brick & Mortar stores reflect with their multitude of case designs/options.  The extra cases options (Gold, Silver, and Black) allow you to &#34;follow through&#34; with whatever iPhone you chose. The case is awesome.Very durable.Has a minimal footprint on the phone so isn't overly large.Like the interchangeable covers.Would recommend. [The Case]The case comes in three parts. Inner shell, outer sell and the interchangeable cover.  The inner shell is made out of a durable hard plastic. It is flexible so it feels like it won't crack on you. It surrounds the outside edges of your phone and the front of your phone using a built in screen protector. The outer shell is made out of rubber. The rubber feels smooth and firm. A really nice feeling. It surrounds the inner case and protects both the back and the edges of your phone. It comes with 3 interchangeable covers. Gold, black and silver. The colors are very simple and subtle. They are made out of smooth hard plastic almost like the inner shell.[Putting it to Use]The case feels really good in your hands. It doesn't feel overly bulky which I like. The screen protector on the inner shell does attract a few fingerprints but nothing a cleaning cloth can't fix. The screen response is good . I didn't have any issues there.  The rubber outer shell provides a good grip for your hands and I really like the fact that this rubber doesn't attract lint from my pocket like other rubber cases do. Also the outer shell covers all your buttons and ports. Using your buttons feels good  and opening the port covers doesn't feel clunky. It has a nice seal when you push the cover back into the port. The really cool thing about this case is the interchangeable covers. You can change it depending on your mood or maybe the type of occasion you'll be attending. Gold would be good for someplace fancy. Black would be for simple subtle day or maybe even silver if you want something sleek. Replacing the back covers is pain free and really easy to do.[Water Resistant Test]I also tested the water resistance of this case. I poured half a cup of water on top of the screen till it over flowed off the edges. I let it sit for a good 10 seconds. Shook off the water and wiped the screen protector. I opened the case and saw no signs of water inside. I believe your phone would survive if someone were to accidently spill some drink over your phone. The only way water would be able to get in is through the speaker holes on the bottom of the phone, through a port if the cover isn't fully closed or if you happen to submerge your phone in water for a long period of time. Good quality.  Was a tight fit for my note 3 even with my slim flex case on it. But after a few days of use, it seems to have stretched and now it slides in and out easier for access as you would want it to when grabbing phone to use. Only 4 stars because for some reason for about the first week every time I pulled my phone out, the ends would have this sticky residue on it from the seams of the case. I'm assuming the glue they used to assemble. Could have done without that hassle of cleaning my case everyday. But that also has seemed to quit over time. As good as any other piece of tempered glass, adhesive is ok. lasted 2 weeks and the screen went crazy hay wired. cheap The product shipped is made by Reiko which I am very happy with.  I have used Reiko before for other phones and they lasted a long time.The back of pouch has both 2 belt loops that looped through the belt and a spring-loaded clip in the center that you can just attach to the belt for quick release.  In the past after years of use my leather-wrapped spring clip the leather was worn out so I just use the belt loop.This case fits my Nexus 5 with a thin TPU cover very well. Well designed, works overt all well. A bit heavy, takes a long time to charge. Quality product though! Does what it is supposed to do. I have it over the Anker extended life battery for the galaxy note 3. It fits but it has a tendency to slip off the left and right sides of the phone a little but it was designed for the Hyperion extended life battery so I', pretty happy that it fits as well as it does. It offers very little in shock protection but its better than nothing. Mine came with one of the two pins broken. I doesn't charge at 2.1 amps. Using GPS on my phone the battery percentage steadily dropped instead of going up, even though it indicated that it was charging with this &#34;2.1 amp&#34; charger. It charges decently, but not as good as others I've bought here. The best was the Verizon branded one with a coiled micro USB cord. I have 3 of those and they work great. Item was provided by manufacturer for review. The review represents my unbiased opinion.This family charger has 4 ports, a 2.4, and 3 1 Amp ports. Despite being a family charger, I can easily use this for myself alone. With all the devices I have (phone, tablet, tablet #2, work phone), I use all 4 ports regularly. It&#8217;s a solid charger that is compact in design as it plugs straight into the wall. When plugged in, you see a light so you know it&#8217;s on. This device makes it easy to travel with extra ports, especially on a cruise ship where there are very few ports, but everyone has a device to charge. It makes it practical, and as each of us gets more devices, we will need extra ports. I only wish Oxa made one with even more ports, since I know I will only need to have more as the future goes and with more power too, since devices are getting more and more power hungry.This is a very practical device that everyone should get and useful for charging multiple devices. The Jawbone connected to my iPhone right away and I have been keeping track of my progress ever since. I haven't had any problems. Much better way of keep track of my exercise than with a pedometer. Personally I love my Jawbone UP24.  It has been a huge help to me in my quest to get enough exercise and sleep.I can't honestly compare it to other similar devices on the market because I have never used an activity tracker or pedometer before.If you are thinking about getting a Jawbone UP24 there are a couple things to be aware of...You need a smartphone and it needs to be smart enough to handle the amount of data that gets uploaded. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3.  I have not had any problems with the UP24 working properly with my phone.  My previous smartphone would never have handled the app.I find that most of the time the reports are fairly accurate but Jawbone can be fooled. If you are pushing a stroller or grocery cart or riding a bicycle and your arm is not swinging it will likely not register your step.  You can easily work around this attaching the Jawbone to the laces of your shoes.Most of the time is is fairly accurate when it tracks my sleep but there have been a few nights where I have been awake and staring at the clock but not sleeping.  Because I was not tossing and turning there was no motion so the device registered that I was in light sleep when I was really wide awake but just not moving.Static electricity and Jawbone UP don't mix well.  Several times I've been folding laundry and my device has shut off. It was an easy fix... If your device stops working just plug it into the recharger, mine has always started working by simply plugging it in to the chargers.  There is also a reset option.What I love about it...I set it to vibrate every 15 minutes if I have not moved.  I spend a lot of time at the computer and the vibrating reminds me to get up and walk around, go get a drink or just do something for a couple minutes.  I'm amazed at how many more steps I take in a day if I do this.It motivates me to go just a little longer or a little further.  Sometimes when I finish a workout I am not far from meeting my daily goal of 10,000 steps so I will walk or jog for another 10 to 15 minutes so I can reach that daily goal.I have its bedtime alarm set to go off at 9:30 each night.  Many nights I have gotten to bed earlier than I would have because of that reminder. I have got a lot more sleep since I got this device.I also use myfitnesspal and strava.  You can connect these apps (as well as a dozen others) to sync with Jawbone.What I wish was different...The only thing I would really change is the fact that there is no way to add steps.  One day I was out hiking and didn't realize my Jawbone was out of power.  I had tracked my hike in strava so I knew how far I had gone and had an approximate number of steps.  I could add the workout to my timeline but Jawbone won't let you add/count those steps in your daily total.Also I think the instructions on how to use Jawbone UP24 are really confusing.  It is not something that is intuitive and it took me a couple days to figure out how it worked. There is no display, just 2 different lights on the arm band and it takes a little time to figure out.I highly recommend this to people like me...  I'm kind of obsessive by nature and love technology. I like comparing what I did this week to last week. I like the reports and little motivational messages that UP sends me about random things. And I like having a way to account for what I've done during the day.  This device just works for me and motivates me.I received my Jawbone UP24 as a thank you gift. The picture seems a little homemade.As if someone copied it onto a phone cover. love it Was a gift for my sister-in-law, and she loved it.  Works and protects well. I bought this mainly for when we travel.  Previously I bought a &#34;BESTek&#34; multiple outlet and two (2) 1 amp USB outputs and two (2) 2.1 amp USB outputs with the 30 pin charger for the iPhone with 6 outlets for when we travel, but find that everyone is usually after the 2 amp, faster charging ports.This is the perfect answer to that, since we don't have a need for the 1 amp ports or really a need for the 30 pin iDevice attachment anymore. With 5 cords coming out of this, it did get a little messy, but was extremely functional and therefore well worth it.This is definitely the BEST way to charge all of your devices (up to 5) while you are traveling, or I guess any time for that matter. Just like the one that came in the box with the Note 3.  I've ordered other USB 3.0 cables but for some reason all the generic and other brands I've tried have a much bigger connector footprint.  This is an issue when you try and charge/connect the Note 3 with a case on it.  The other brands, the connector housing is too big.  I have to remove the case prior to connecting.  With this OEM one, the connector housing is much slimmer and enables charging/docking without having to remove the case from my Note 3. Great for the price and very good quality. This phone I LOVE! cheap to buy at Amazon, and it works great on Consumer Cellular, my provider. I was going to buy a new IPod touch to replace my old one, but it cost more than this phone, and I wanted a new phone anyway, so it was an easy decision for me to buy this. I use it more for APPS than phone calls, and I have the Cellular Data disabled, so all my data usage is through WiFi, either from my home router of Cablevision's Optimum WiFi, which is all over the New York/ Long Island area. My data plan with Consumer Cellular is only for 100 MB (yes, MB!!) and I typically use over 2 GB or more a month. Excellent WiFi connectivity with this phone.Battery life for me is about as good or bad as anybody else's smart phone. I get more than 24 hours on each charge.I am not a power user for business, but I do use the phone a bit :-)Did I say I love it? i LOVE it! For the price, it's an incredible phone. We bought it for my friend for his birthday in the middle of September last year and his still loves it. The screen looks great, the battery life is good, and it works on Metro PCS. It doesn't have LTE but you'd probably end up paying $250 if this phone were LTE compatible with 16gb of storage A killer phone for the bucks. This is a handy little battery pack.  What sets it apart from the growing field of packs (search and you will find lots) is the attached charging cables.  The cables nestle flat into slots on each side of the device, so when carried, it's essentially a brick with no protrusions.  This means one less thing to stuff into a pocket when heading off somewhere that I might need to charge on the go.  I would swear that it charges an iPhone considerably faster than the Anker or Duracell power bricks I have used, but I have not actually tested that. Has 1 micro-USB cable for Android devices and 1 iPhone5 cable permanently attached to the body. That's nice since you'll never lose it. But if the cable fails, that's end of this device. The cable seems sturdy enough that I don't expect that to happen.It charged up overnight. It charges my phones just fine. Doesn't weigh too much. It's great to have for extended outing where I may not be near an outlet for a day. I always comes along with me when I fly. Airports have gotten better at providing outlets and charging stations, but there's often a wait or are too far from my gate. So I bypass that altogether by bringing this along. I didn't have any luck with putting this protector on. Great case for the dough.For my son's Moto G. Wish they made a case for Moto X. Case is just too big and not built very well. This MOCREO Universal World Wide All-in-one Safety Travel Charger is a very versatile device that can convert to fit many specific wall plug adaptations around the world: specifically to meet requirements in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Europe, and 150 countries that use their plug configurations. This device does NOT do power, current, or voltage conversion of any type: it simply passes the power from the wall power receptacle thru the Universal plug adapter to the electronic device/appliance on the other end of the Universal plug adapter. No grounding: the USA plug has only 2 prongs. &#34;This product is for use with unearthed or double-insulated appliances only&#34;. It may not work with certain high power devices requiring more than 6 amps such as hair dryers. Each country has its own regulations for using these devices, so please check before use.This device has a multiple input receptacle on top that can accept a UK, USA, Australian, and European power plug attached to an electronic device. Then by selecting from a 3-position switch on the side marked &#34;U.K.&#34;, &#34;EUROPE&#34;, &#34;USA/AUS&#34;, the proper plug is deployed for plugging into a wall of the foreign country. Blue LEDs light up when plugged in. For the UK and USA, a specific plug comes out of either end. However, in order to get the European plug, one must push the selector switch to the &#34;Europe&#34; position and push the selector button to deploy the two prongs from the bottom. In addition, there are 2 USB charging ports of 1 Amp and 2.1 Amps for charging smartphones, tablets, and computers. Read the instructions carefully before use. I am in the USA and tested this device on an appliance with a UK plug which I plugged into the top of this unit and deployed the US plug and plugged it into my wall receptacle: the appliance worked. I also used both USB plugs successfully for charging smartphones. Highly Recommended for specific ungrounded applications. Four and a half FLEXIBLE Stars. (MOCREO Universal World Wide All-in-One Safety Travel Charger with dual USB charger with instructions. This device was provided by the manufacturer for testing and an impartial review.) This is a very efficient international wall charger that I would not travel without when abroad...It is very easy to use and has two USB ports with a blue light indicator when plugged in the wall...It covers more than 150 countries with US/EU/UK/AU plugs..Built in safety shutters protect users from the direct touch of live parts on the socket outlet..Only one plug type can be used at one time by sliding the knob selection and the other plug-pins are locked automatically...AC power rating is 660w max. at 110V..One USB port output is 2100mA and the second USB port output is 1000mA...It comes with very important and easy to understand instructions...I highly recommend because now a days we all have our phones and laptops and tablets..We are always traveling with something.....Like my KPW that charged perfectly...Sample provided for review..... The MOCREO Universal World Wide All-in-one charger is an extremely convenient device. While there are innumerable travel chargers on the market, the MOCREO is pretty unique because you can plug in your wall-powered electronics while simultaneously charging two USB devices, e.g. an iPhone and iPad (at full speed, no less!).I only have a couple of complaints:1.) It does feel a bit... plastic. I'm nervous to be too aggressive with the country-specific prong button.2.) There's a rather bright blue LED that lights up when the device is plugged into the wall, to let you know it's working. However, it's a little too bright for my liking.Overall, though, 4.75 out of 5. Excellent stuff.*Sample provided for review.* This is a really nice case. It's strong and adds plenty of protection for your precious baby. Down side to it is the kick stand it would be perfect if it was metal. The plastic one popped off the first day. Lucky I was not broken and easy to attract. The only other thing was the white lettering. It fade within the first week, mite be a bit of an overkill but I don't need to advertise what case I have. If anyone want to know I'm more then happy to tell them. Just food for though. Collects dust and lint along the edges of the screen that you need to wipe.Very snug fit. will not come off unless you take it off.All holes and buttons line up exact.Miss the indented M logo circle on the back of the phone tho, that helped me to orient when taking photos or pulling the phone out of my pocket.Haven't dropped my phone yet.Not as sexy as some of the others available, in terms of thinness, but seems more protective than those really thin shells they are selling, for I'm not sure what purpose to want to buy them?! I've always had good experiences with AmazonBasics products, and this lightning car charger isn't an exception. It's inexpensive and it gets the job done. However, there are a couple things that don't work particularly well for me:First, the cable is a bit short, stretching a maximum of a couple feet. This makes it impossible for me to have my phone in its dashboard stand while charging -  though this might not be an issue depending on the placement of your cigarette lighter. Second, the lighting end of the charger (i.e. the end that plugs into the phone) is a bit thicker than the standard apple design. So if I want to plug my phone in, I have to take it out of its case.As I said, the charger works well, and ff course these are both minor annoyances. But they are definitely worth taking into consideration before purchasing. I find that this charger doesn't seem to fit quite my car's socket -- if I'm not careful, it will pop out slightly and my phone won't charge properly. So while it does work if I make sure it's really wedged in there, too often it seems to not work properly because it just isn't in all the way and I haven't noticed. I've never had this issue with any other car charger, so I don't think it's my vehicle (MB GL450). This case doesn't stay on my phone real well but I like it Amazing EDIT:  Added a star for the excellent customer service.It's a little finicky about the placement of my Nexus 5.  My son says that it won't work with his Seidio kickstand case on his Nexus 5. This is small enough to fit into a pocket. I keep this charged up in my car for when I need it. I've already had to use it twice and it charges my S3 up in no time. I picked up an OtterBox when my son got his first iPhone. His phone has been dropped, kicked, sat on, you name it, and there's not a mark on the phone anywhere (though the silicone has torn in a few places and the plastic case itself has a crack). A friend of mine recently picked up the Nokia LG G Flex and he works in construction, so I knew he needed this. I now have an Otterbox on all my devices and they have yet to let me down. Some devices we have owned for over 3 years and upon taking off the case, they still look brand new. Not a mark on them. I won't use anything else until my kiddos are older and can handle these things more carefully. I still cringe a bit when I see my very expensive and very shiny gadget falling to the floor, but it is well protected with the OtterBox Defender. It's been dropped from as high as 4 feet, and though I don't dare do it myself, I've seen video reviews of it being dropped from 3 stories and then being run over by a car with no damage to the phone.Just want to point out, this case is NOT waterproof, but it will protect it from minor spills. The Nokia G Flex has been drenched more than once and come out completely dry. The case seems complicated when you first look at it, but it's actually really simple to put on and also to take off, IF you know how to do it, meaning your kids will have no idea how to get it off. Love the built in screen protector also. Keeps moisture out and no annoying bubbles to deal with! Can't recommend enough for all your gadgets. I still use my S3 and needed to replace the battery from having it too long. I purchased Noot 2200mah battery and noticed the much needed boost. The one battery I had purchased drained too fast. I contacted Noot support and they were very fast to replace the battery honoring their 24 month warranty! Replacement battery has been great. I purchased this battery because I was plagued with having a dead Samsung Galaxy S4 midway through my morning workday. I thought about switching back to an iPhone but didn't want to part with the functionality, real estate, and resolution of the S4's screen. After doing a little research I thought of purchasing 2 extra batteries. Glad to say that these worked out perfectly. I whenever I am low on juice I swap the battery out with a freshly charged battery and I am in business- literally.  So to sum it up, I am very happy with this battery as it provides no difference in battery life from the OEM battery, is just as light, and its quite cheap. Item was provided by manufacturer for review. The review represents my unbiased opinion.For the size of the speaker, this speaker has pretty good sound. I&#8217;ve had many other bluetooths made from plastic, but being made from wood, the sound was better. There was less vibrations because it is made from wood. The audio is crisper and cleaner.Getting started is easy due to NFC. NFC makes it easy to pair the Bluetooth device with any NFC enabled device. Super quick and easy. You can also hook up an audio out, or micro SD card as well as FM radio. The easiest thing for me was micro SD since I can just start up the device and play music. If I want to, I can hook up my phone via Bluetooth or computer as well.Keep in mind the size of this is about the size of your hands, but for the size, the audio is great. On one charge, I was able to use it for about 4 hours over Bluetooth. I imagine that it would be longer with micro SD alone.This is easily something I can put in every room, but for now, sits in my kitchen so when I cook, I can listen to music. Great product for the price. Had resisted a few drops already.Only complaint is that it takes a while to remove it from the phone. But that's cool because I rarely do that and that means it won't come apart when I drop it. I guess my expectations are met because I have not dropped my phone as of yet  to really be able to test out the product and I only hope I do not. But, if and when that occurs, I will surely let you know.  Otherwise, I like the product and it looks pleasing to the eye in protecting my Samsung S5.  I bought this product because of the design and the details in how this particular design is to protect my cell phone, especially the supposed shock absorbers on each side.  So, thus far, I will give it 5 stars.After experiencing dropping a cell phone (that was one day from being insured), and having to pay for a new phone without a contract since it was two soon to upgrade - I thought I better get the best thing out there or what I felt was the best. Quality case,  very sturdy.  Cover snaps in place and stays shut until you want to open it.  Will not work with the smart view already installed on the S5 because this case does not replace the back plastic cover on the phone which is necessary. I found though that if you download S View Plus you can make it work with this case or Spigen Smart View Plus works. Great price and quality. Love the color and its light weight as well. This I would definitely purchase this again as well as try other products that Spigen makes in the future for my all next future cell phones. This is a Go. Excellent quality with sturdy cord, as advertised. The have already been put to use with my Samsung S5 phone for charging and downloading.  Quick shipping via USPS came on time.  That was a surprise. I needed an extra for work. Works great. First of all I would like to say that these headphones are one of the best over the head headphones I have ever used. It was totally blown away by its quality and durability.Since these headphones are foldable, they come in a small box and does not require too much room to put in your backpack or purse or any other carry ons.Design is very compact and comfortable to wear over your head. Material is very durable and lightweight.Moreover, they don't even hurt your ears while wearing them for long period of time. I tested this headphone for a week and wore is few hours sometime.The battery life is very impress on this headphone. I used the headset after fully charging it first. Then I used it for hours while taking breaks in between. I used it for listening to music and talking on phone as well. And the battery lasted for approximately for about 14 hours before it needed to be charged again. This is lot longer than other expensive bluetooth headsets.The quality of the music is excellent that can blow your mind. If you love listening to lots of music, you will love this headphones and can enjoy the rich listening experience anywhere you want.This wireless headset does not affect the audio quality at all comparing to lot of other wireless headsets.One of the best feature is the ease of music control using side function buttons such as Play, Pause, Next, Previous, Volume. These buttons can also be used to talk on phone with clear sound both ways.Another great feature that I love is that this bluetooth headset can be paired with two Bluetooth-enabled devices at the same time.Overall, for $39.99, this bluetooth headphone is worth every penny. You will not be disappointed. I will recommend this for all music lovers especially the people who listen to music while at gym. You can't beat this price for the quality you will be getting. I was unclear at first why this product needed to have the Micro-USB part at all, because I mainly wanted a lightning cable...but I have found it to be the perfect cord I was missing for travel.  The Micro USB part (which is &#34;behind&#34; the Lightning part when it's all connected) is often the cord you need for accessories such as Bluetooth headsets or (in my case) a charging iPhone case.I thought 3 feet would seem very short, but it actually is fine, enough to get it from a floor plug to a table, nightstand, or desk (but you wouldn't want to try to talk on your iPhone while it's plugged in!). In fact, I think that I'll stay away from longer cords in the future -- they actually wear out faster when you CAN use your device while it's plugged in, since you keep pulling or putting weigh on it while it's plugged in.The cords are VERY well made, unlike most other brands of iPhone cords I've used.  There is a little gray double loop rubber cord that keep the Lightning cord segment from getting lost when it's unplugged and you're using the MicroUSB plug...genius!  I'm sure that would have gotten lost by now.  It does not interfere with the use of the product nor does it make it seem bulkier, either.Overall, a well-made, versatile product that was properly thought out.  Especially love that little tether to keep parts from getting lost!  Oh, and yes, it plugs into any USB port (not included). The case is the perfect one for your HTC One M8.  I never dropped the phone with the case, but I know the case will protect it.  Spigen makes this style of case for several other phones, and they're all the same with the idea of great looks and protection.  There's a reason why there are fakes out there - because they're the best! They are good when brand new, After a short while they lose the stickiness.  Would not recommend. It's not something so important that I would like to take the time every few days to wash.  If you don't mind washing it often, go ahead. It might stick longer that way, but I'm not sure. Love the length. Doesn't seem to charge my phone that well though :/ love it . love the combination of grey and pick. I have really liked the cases from Caseology. I used a 1 piece on my Galaxy S3 and really liked it. it had a nice texture that stayed in my hand. This one However is a bit more slick. BUT, it gets 4 stars because it does a realy good job of protecting my new Galaxy S5. I like the fact that it is two pieces so it is easy to clean if you drop it... in the mud... yes ive done that already. It is a bit bulkier than their other cases, which I think is because of the plastic hard shell. I have dropped it multiple times on my tile floors and have yet to see any marks on the case at all. Love. love it! I picked up an OtterBox when my son got his first iPhone. His phone has been dropped, kicked, sat on, you name it, and there's not a mark on the phone anywhere (though the silicone has torn in a few places and the plastic case itself has a crack). A friend of mine recently picked up the Nokia Lumia and he works in construction, so I knew he needed this. I now have an Otterbox on all my devices and they have yet to let me down. Some devices we have owned for over 3 years and upon taking off the case, they still look brand new. Not a mark on them. I won't use anything else until my kiddos are older and can handle these things more carefully. I still cringe a bit when I see my very expensive and very shiny gadget falling to the floor, but it is well protected with the OtterBox Defender. It's been dropped from as high as 4 feet, and though I don't dare do it myself, I've seen video reviews of it being dropped from 3 stories and then being run over by a car with no damage to the phone.Just want to point out, this case is NOT waterproof, but it will protect it from minor spills. The Nokia Lumia has been drenched more than once and come out completely dry. The case seems complicated when you first look at it, but it's actually really simple to put on and also to take off, IF you know how to do it, meaning your kids will have no idea how to get it off. Love the built in screen protector also. Keeps moisture out and no annoying bubbles to deal with! Can't recommend enough for all your gadgets. Had a very bad smell. These screen protectors are extremely clear, and so far, are pretty durable.  Installation is little tricky, but not impossible to be successful. I did waste one of the three protectors during installation.  The biggest challenge was aligning the screen protector around the edges where it was difficult to get the it to bond to the edges.  The included dust stickers make dust removal a cinch.  I could not get rid of all air bubbles during my two installation attempts.Overall, I like these screen protectors, and have already seen their value since it has resisted scratches from keys and coins in my pocket (my typical carrying location for my phone). I recommend the iSmooth Premium Elite Screen protectors to anyone looking for durability and quality. this is okay I received a sample from Maxboost for review. Initially I was stoked about getting a 2+ A dual charger, But now I'm um impressed.Pros: Small design, Charge both iDevices and Android, Nice grip area for inserting and removing from the power port. Lit usb ports for use in the dark.Cons: the 2.4Ah port would not charge my Samsung Galaxy S3, The phone appeared to charge but I went from 13% to 9% during a half hour drive with screen on.Other: My phone generally gets very hot while charging so I do not know if the overheating protection is looking for information from the phone, or if it is looking at current draw. either way My phone still got hot while using this charger (2.0A port)Overall I would recommend this to a family with both Android and iDevices, but would not recommend it to someone that has all Android or iDevices. I like the film. It's clear and easy to put on. Simple, thick and protects. Nothing really special about these screen protectors compared to other ones except these seem a little thicker and the quality seems a little nicer. Installation was pretty easy but I've been installing protectors for a while now so it's always pretty easy for me. This is an inexpensive screen protector,  but it's of very good quality . The easy application ensured there were  no bubbles, easy dirt/dust removal, and crystal clear. Great customer service would buy again. Ugh.  Don't buy this.  The Bluetooth sound is choppy in that it cuts out every couple of seconds.  Can't use this at all.  Wasted $25. This cable works with every Apple device I've thrown at it that has 8-Pin Lightning flawlessly!I use to use an OEM Apple charging cable connected to a USB (3ft) extension cable on my night stand next to my bed so I could use my phone while it charged in bed. Often the USB extension would come disconnected or simply needed to be re-connected to get charging to just initiate. This is no longer an issue thanks to the AYL 6ft cable that is of better quality than the Apple OEM cable.The data transfer speeds this cable are on par with the OEM Apple cable. I've used this cable on PC's and MACs with USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 with no issues so far. Transfer speeds are consistent and fast and charging times are fast and consistent as well. Very good cable. Cable is thicker than an OEM Apple cable which some may hate but its actually far better than the OEM cable because of this reason. OEM cables crimp extremely easily and the OEM cables also fray extremely easily and quickly. Due to the thickness of the AYL cable this isn't an issue at all.Great quality, perfect length, charging times are great and transfer speeds are great. Seriously, no complaints at all.

When the original cable for my husbands Ipod broke i figured id have to go out and get another one at my local store. However I got offered this one and I'm so glad. It works very well and seems quiet sturdy.One of the best parts is that is very affordable compared to the apple brand and from what I can tell actually works better. I had no problem charging from a wall unit, or syncing and charging from my computer. So if you need a new one or just need a back up I would recommend this model.**I received a sample of this product to test and review. All opinions are honest and my own.** Bought a couple of these for travel to Paris and London.They worked great - and having 2 USB ports to charge tablets and phones was very convenient.  Best part is that I'm still using them after our trip as extra USB chargers around the house. Battery started failing on DNA, so had to get a new phone off contract.  The one I got did not have a nanoSIM card, so I had to go to Verizon with the phone (IMEI) to get one. They said they HAD to activate the card in store.  Of course, had to make sure it did not affect my plan.  The DNA had a microSIM card.Speakers are great.Yet to try the camera thoroughly, but will soon.  As long as the quality is better or at least as good as the DNA, I will be more than happy.  I mostly take photos of dogs that are up for adoption at the local animal shelter.  Action shots are not necessary except in HD video.Surprised that the LG G3 for Verizon is at a much lower retail price for off contract than this m8 which has been out for a while now.I do like that they made the pattern lock smaller and at the bottom of the screen where the thumb naturally is.When I start from locked, it goes to Google Search. I need to find out how to make that stop. Wow, I love this.  We used this in the motorhome to charge all of our phones and tablets at once.  It works extremely well.  There are outlets specifically for tablets and for phones.  They charged quickly and without any issues.  This is a huge space saver too.  It feels very sturdy and well made.  The whole thing comes in a small box and was easy to set up.Sample provided Great price and quality. I was first very skeptical with the new brand name but the product does what it describes. It charges 5 items all at once. I would definitely purchase this again as well as try other products that Poweradd makes in the future for my all next future cell phones, tablets and other electronics. This is a Go. Great fitting case and looks good. As good as the other reviews claim it is!  Cleaned the phone screen with the alcohol pad, wiped it off with the microfiber cloth then I used the hinge method.  I placed it on my phone and lined it up then placed painters tape on one side and lifted it up, removed the plastic film and dropped it on and it lined up perfect.  I placed my finger in the middle of the screen and all the air went out for a perfect install!  You seriously can not see it on the phone,  love it! I purchased 2 Noot replacement batteries for the Samsung 5. Being on the phone so much and away from a charger, we carry these around with us and replace when our main battery dies. We do notice that the Noot battery supplies more battery and last longer than the original battery that came with the phone. For the price, you can't beat it. And the 24 month warranty! I have had many different smartwatches and the Galaxy Gear 2 Neo surpasses them all.  Heartbeat monitor is a little touchy but still great.  Lots of ways to customize the watch and watch faces.  Since it is new there are not a ton of apps but they are rolling out fast.  Calling from the watch is great,  can hear the person we and they can hear me very well.  Notifications are immediate and easy to read.  Watch looks great,  not too large, band is comfortable but look forward to new bands.  If you have any questions feel free to ask,  I will gladly help.  I recommend this smartwatch to every person. everything is ok except for the usb cover. it keeps on popping out. love it The Samsung is very similar to the Eachine X-Power Serie X2 and contains a whopping 10,400mAh, which is a good chunk of power - enough to charge most Smartphone's about five times and an iPad at least twice (fully). 10,000 mAh is really the minimum you want in a power bank. Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. The small hand-size (approximately 5.5 X 2.5 X 1) is great for packing.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 8.6 ounces. It also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful, but using this light will eat up your battery power quickly.  It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device.This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V/1.0A charge for most other devices.  In between these ports is the Micro-USB port for charging - the power cord is included along with extra adapters for other electronic devices.  These are all on the narrower side.  The emergency light is on the top narrow edge of the unit.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%). That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left. I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let's say, four LED lights that represent 25% each. With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.  It's a nice bright blue on the white background on the wide side of the unit with an On/Off button next to it.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. I like this power bank more than most I own simply for its small size and big power. This product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review.

This product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review. cute  i liked it The charger is great. I actually purchased 2 Noot S5 car chargers. One for each car. Both chargers work with no issues. The cord attached to the charger is long enough to have plugged in and reach your ear as you sit in the car. There have been no problems with the connector that plugs into the bottom of the phone. It stays firmly in the phone and charges with interruptions. Also, our phones charge very fast when using the Noot charger. Overall, this charger works great with the Samsung 5 phone. It delivers what it promises. I have used XtremeGuard screen protectors for a long time and I only get them when they have deals. Which is very annoying. This screen protector is just as good and cost just as much when xtremeguard have a 90% off sale. I have to say that NOOT did an amazing job with this screen protector.1. Comes with a nice case so the screen protector doesn't shatter in the mail.2. The cloth it comes with is very top quality.3. Extremely easy to apply the screen protector. I usually hate doing this but it was so easy and no dust or air pockets.4. CRYSTAL clear. This screen protector is amazing. Like it is not even there when using it.5. Anti-fingerprint. This glass screen protector does a really good job of reducing the amount of oil and finger print marks. My old glass screen protector was really durable but I had to always wipe it off BC it had so much oil on it. With this one I almost never have to do it. And when I do a few scrubs with a shirt work. I got this case for my mom, actually, who just got her first iPhone, and doesn't have insurance on it.  :-)Overall, I'll say that this case does an EXCELLENT job at protecting the iPhone.  It doesn't have a screen protection element to it, but I find those to be completely annoying, and unnecessary if you are an adult and keep your iPhone in a pocket or purse side pocket anyway.The case has a soft silicone inner part, which is partially covered by a hard plastic outer case, which especially protects the corners.  It uses to be that most two-part iPhone cases has the soft part on the outside, but actually it is better on the inside for two reasons: it absorbs shock better this way, and also it is easier to slip in and out of a pocket with the smooth hard part on the outside.  Enough of the gray silicone sticks on on the sides to give this excellent grip, and on the back to keep it (somewhat) from sliding off your lap, table, etc.The only drawbacks?  It's very bulky (similar to an Otterbox), and it's not terribly attractive.  However, the price is right, so if you don't care a lot about appearances, this may be the protective case for you! The Case Logic Extreme is everything the listing claims to be - a 2 piece plastic and silicone case designed to be slim, stylish AND protective.  I trust this case to protect our precious Galaxy phone.  Sure it isn't an otterbox, but it also does not add the weight nor the bulk of an otterbox. This Case Logic case is more in the mid-range... offers reasonable protection.  If you think you need an Otterbox, then you very likely NEED an Otterbox (and realize that the cost is reflective, as well..) This case has a pretty color and good texture. The lip sets up a little from the screen which offers a little protection.  This is a good functional case that is slim and light weight. It offers protection from superficial scratches but does not provide protection passed that aspect. The Case Logic CLS5-104 is a stylish case that is suitable for most busy executives. With blue/gray fabric backing, it looks great on my husband's S5 and I trust the case to protect it from the typical bumps and bangs his phone generally endures.  Overall I am satisfied this case will protect our investment while not adding any significant weight or dimension, which is vital for someone with hand dexterity issues. Very good product and it looks a great fit for the phone. I am unable to give the full 5 stars as somehow I feel the case adds a bit of bulk to the phone and is a little over priced. I do hope this extra bulk gives the extra protection for my G3. I have the Gunmetal color.Probably would have given 5 stars if the pricing was $9.99. I really like this case! No cut outs!!! Be aware to purchase through SPIGEN!Its a sleek case, its fits really good the G3. It could have more grip in the back though. Other than that, I am very pleased with this case! broke by the second day Everything works fine Out of the many cases I have owned in the past three years, this is probably the best one I have purchased. While I can't comment on protection since I haven't tested it (nor do I plan to), the thickness of the case assures me that the phone will be protected in a drop. It feels sturdy in the hand and doesn't add much bulk at all.Some people were saying that the beveled edges are sharp. This might have been an isolated problem for them, since the edges are not sharp on my case and the phone is comfortable to hold. The case actually increases grip on the phone.As for style, it's one of the better looking cases for the LG G3. The back cutouts are very attractive, and the cutouts for the ports are precise and do not obstruct any openings. The black color goes very nicely with my gold G3.Overall I would recommend this case to anyone who's looking for good protection with style. I thought the back part of this headset goes on the head, but we wear it around the neck.  The earphones are attached to the frame via weak magnets and connected to it with thin cords.  Remove the earbuds and place them in the ears.  It looks a little funny, but we don't have cords dangling everywhere, just a frame around our necks.  When done, store the buds on the frame.Bluetooth paired easily.  It always reconnects.  Range is very good.  Controls are easy to reach.  Music sounds fine for this non-audiophile, at least when I'm sitting still at my desk.  Just don't go for a walk.What's that?  If you've ever worn earplugs, you know how the sounds of the body are magnified.  That is the sensation I got when I went out.  I heard myself walk, every step on the pavement.  The wind blew across the ears and the hair brushed against the cord, it was severe cord thump.Sit still and all will be good.This product was provided for review by Rockit Boost. I really like the length of this USB cable.  It is after market so it does not have the Samsung logo imprinted on it but that is fine. This is exactly what I have been looking for for my 93-year-old father who still lives alone in his own house. I am constantly worried that he is going to fall or have a stroke and not be able to contact anyone. He refuses to wear a Life Alert bracelet because he doesnt' think he needs it. Ahem. He loves the idea of having a cell phone like me, and he has taken t o the Jiterbug5 like a duck to water. He has reminders sent to him 3 times a day to let him know when he is supposed to take his medications. This phone is compact enough for him to keep in his pocket, yet the numbers are large enough for him to manipulate with ease. There are buttons he knows to push should he have an emergency. I have been waiting to find a device like this for a long time. I'm so happy that we got the Great Call Jiterbug5 phone for him. It gives me much needed peace of mind. It gives my dad the security to reach out for help anytime he might need it. A great product. Highly recommended. Hubby says it works great! Love Amazon  convenience. Thanks. These cables lasted only a few weeks before they stopped working.  Unfortunately it was beyond the return period.  Would not recommend purchasing these. very happy with these protectors These cables worked great. No problems charging my iphone or ipad. This was a great price for 2 cables . works perfect and chargers my phone quickly. Great quality, no overheating, no burn out, worked just fine, thanks! I was really surprised that this bluetooth headset was as good as it is. It fits my ear fairly well, it stays on 100%, it is easy to locate (nice bright blue) and is very well made. The sound quality on my end has been superb, but I occasionally have complaints from one person that the sound quality is not good for them when I'm talking on this.I can leave it off when I'm driving and it's easy to put on my ears to take a phone call. This charges fast as well and maintains a long battery life. The controls are easy to operate. One of the things I like best about this headset is the ear insert. This is far superior to the same price range single ear bluetooth headsets that have a foam covering that gets lost or a removable plastic ear loop that falls off. This is all in one piece and very high quality. Music sounds amazing as well!I would definitely buy another should I lose this one, and am very pleased in every aspect with this headset. These headphones stay on the head relatively easily, are light and unobtrusive. Bright, reflective color for safety and, well, fun.Sweat and moisture repellent for durability. Includes smartphone armband for workout use.It was hard for me to evaluate the sound because I couldn't get a good fit. The earpieces pushed forward against the inside of my ear, and after a while causes some discomfort. Due to this fit I also couldn't get good sound isolation. However, many reviewers here seem to have gotten it to fit their ears, so maybe it's due to my misshapen head.Assuming you have normal ear canals, it seems these might work for you. I'll be trying them more to see if there are adjustments that will make them work for me. This is a super conveinant charger/battery that snaps right onto your phone, easy cheesy!  Fast charge and also doubles as protection should you drop your phone.  Highly recommended!I was gifted the above charger for my unbiased review. I have trouble putting on most of the screen protectors I have tried over the years. Either I don't get all the bubbles, out. or some tiny speck of dust gets trapped underneath it, and appears 100 times bigger once sealed behind the screen cover!  I have been known to go through 4 or 5  screen protectors before getting one on the way I think it should be.Well not this time. These worked great, the FIRST TIME through!Turns out, the instructions make ALL the difference here.  The instructions for this screen protector was clear, and easy to follow, and made it much much easier to get the protector on without bubbles, or dirt specks ruining it.  I'm very pleased! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  This is just what I needed to keep my iPhone on me while riding my bike.  The armband fits nicely and other than the weight of the phone I can barely tell that I'm wearing it. Tested the charger and it is 5V 2amp. And it charged the phone quickly. I would buy another and recommend this item This is a solid charger, which seems well constructed, and gives a fast charge to my Galaxy Note 2.  The insulation on the cord could be made of a bit sturdier material, but otherwise, I can find nothing to complain about.  It does what it is supposed to do quite well, and will last a long time if you protect the cord from getting damaged. Works just like the oem one I got when i got my phone. as described and so cute, my niece loved it I was looking for a sharp iPhone case that you don't really see everyday and I found it!  This case is so nice on the phone, I just love it. When heading out for a night on the town, this case provides the shine and sophistication I need. It looks and feels amazing. A great addition to my phone. Really cool texture, it feels good in my hands. Probably one of the best cases I ever had. My boyfriend wanted a phone case to protect his phone but didn't want a typical case that you find at the mall.  When I saw this I thought it was perfect and he loves it!  So glad I got this, it's very sleek and stylish. This case is smooth and elegant. It has a nice finish that is comfortable to hold onto and doesn't cost a fortune. It works wonderfully with my black iPhone. Worth the money. My boyfriend has this case and he really likes it. He usually rotates different cases often and he's been sticking with this one lately so I know he's pretty smitten with it. I got this for a friend who loves animal print and she just loves this case.  It's definitely unique. Our oldest is an animal lover, so when she saw this case she really pushed for me to get it. I bought it and have been in love with it ever since. How can you not love the look and feel of this case? Unleash your inner spirit with this stunning case. My daughter is really into animal print so she flipped when I surprised her with this one. She's now asking me for a zebra striped one as well. If you're looking for a one of a kind phone case, this is it.  Real python that looks and feels authentic.  Bought it for a snake lover and they were so impressed, they just love it! Perfect gift for a family member who loved snakes. They said it allows them to grip their phone with ease, while still looking amazing. My boyfriend also has this case and he adores it, it looks very realistic upclose. This is such a cool case.  I got it for myself but my boyfriend likes to use it sometimes.  The studs are just so sharp. Get your stud their own studded case with this beautiful design. It was worth the investment and feels amazing. Worth every penny. I got this case for the texture and I've been loving it ever since, I think it's really edgy and mysterious and I'm find any reason to pull my phone out in public when I have this case on! Works great just like my original one. I really need extras of these for the car and house so love this and the price! Great product. Great packaging. High quality and apple certified. Works greats. This was a good replacement for my apple cable that is falling apart. I highly recommend this cable. This is a great cable, just as good as the more expensive Apple one. My husband and my daughter both lost their original cables for their iPhones and they went the cheap route, buying a cheap replacement cable, I believe it messed up their battery memory because coincidentally both of them have battery hold/charge issues but my son and I do not. I used this cable to charge my husbands phone and it charged it from 3% to 100% in about an hour, that's about how long it takes my phone to charge but with the cheap cable his takes 2-1/2 hours. I'm thrilled with the quality of this cable, I'm hoping now that we have &#34;quality&#34; cables again, maybe the battery memory will improve on their phones.  Great cable at a great price. I definitely recommend. product as described, I have wasted a lot of money on cords. I would buy them (usually on road trips) and then go to plug my phone in just to discover I have to work with cord and leave my phone sit while it was charging. This cord has not given me any issues, works just like my original!! Good quality At times I find it hard for the phone to stay inside the holder while on my hip.  The holder allows for the phone to be able to spin around but when it spins the phone almost begins to fall out and that would cause the phone to fall out and be damaged.  Its seems its only a matter of time before it does ,other than that it is a good case. Great Dock. Works well with a case on the phone and easy to use. Wish it came with a plug as well but good item for a good price. I am a big fan of Anker products, I have 5 of their chargers from the 20000mAh to the 10000mAh, plus two 40w 5 port chargers. As with my other products this one works with my s5 perfectly. Awesome. Took seconds to install perfectly. Weill always buy these for every new iPhone. Stays in both positions well, padded enough that I'm not concerned tossing it around while closed. Soft lining protects the screen (I don't use screen protectors). Great, inexpensive product. It's okay Very good and useful I guess with this its just a chance because I got 2 of these a pink one and a blue one pink work great wife loves it my blue one work for a one time use oh well I guess its a role of the dice Good quality iphone protectors.... super easy to put on.  Better than the ones I purchased at the store and a great price.  You can also rinse them off and reapply if you have trouble the first time or if you get dust in one accidently.  They're not the cheap plastic ones you find other places, these are nice! It exceeded my expectations.  The charging pad is small in size, but it works better than I expected.  I'm able to charge my son's Nexus tablet with out any problems. Finally I got the right one it is just the right sized and everything line up. As stated in my other review, I am A BIG fan of Otter Box products, I use them on my phones and my entire family. Never seem to have enough of these.  I bought two other types prior for my son, this is the one he sticks with.  Fits well, very neat.Would buy again. Buttery smooth and scratch resistant for almost 6 months now..... Slllooooowwww charging! But it does the job. Not to mention the color was... Idk... FUN! This is a great portable charger. I keep it at my office desk. When not in use, I keep it retracted which keeps it looking neat. It seems to charge the phone quickly but I have never actually timed it. I have it plugged into a powered USB hub so that may help. Bottom Line: It's a great product at a great price. I purchased this as a replacement for another purchase that got sent to me broken from a different style. I am very glad the other was sent to me broken.This speaker connects via bluetooth but also includes auxiliary audio cable along with the charging cable.The speaker has a very nice range from the device via bluetooth and has a very good sound. It also has a headphone jack to plug in headphones instead.This device also has a radio, that though kind of difficult to set up, works very well after the initial set up.This speaker set also has the ability to play .MP3 files directly off of an inserted micro-SD or USB drive, This feature is very handy for quick playing.The design threw me at first... I just didn't like it. But the olive/football shape is very comfortable to hold, the unit has a flat bottom to sit well on the desk and the buttons and controls don't stick out much making it easy enough to slip into a pocket.There is a blue light that flashes constantly while it is in use, this turns red while it is charging. I personally don't like lights flashing near me, for this speaker it often distracted me while I was watching Netflix... a piece of electrical tape fixed it perfectly without marring the overall appearance. Very nice case I love it Great product The Hyperion TPU case for the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 extended battery setup will provide the basic protection for your Galaxy S4 when installed. It's not going to prevent any major damage from occurring if the phone is dropped. It is pretty much going to prevent the phone from taking a few nicks here and there and save the back of it from scratches. really good quality, looks nice on my phone! Great sound quality for music and connects easily, but the worst headset for use with a cellphone. No one can hear a word that you say. There is no way to regulate mic volume, so it is far too low unless you yell your private conversations. Awesome.  When you have about a hundred things plugged in with a bunch of kids and devices, these allow you to discriminate and avoid unplugging something.  This coupled with the multiport USB plug also purchased, allows less arguments in the house, with each kid getting a color.I will buy more of these, soon. it is ok the touch is not sensitive enough. but it protect it. Simple design but works so well. I use it with my iPhone 5 in my car that does not have a convenient place to put a mount. Bought this for my son as his other phone was going out. Really likes the extra features his other phone didn't provide. Very slim, high quality, and attractive case! I purchased this after buying a competing, cheaper case. The other case did not have the raised camera guard. This one does. When I would lay my phone down face up, the other case left the camera exposed and it was getting scratched. This one meets all of my needs! No complaints with spigen protector. Did it's job and clear. Very nice got more than what I paid for very surprising I love it it keeps my screen real good and easy to install very good item people u won't regret this buy Works perfectly on My wife's s4. Installed in 2 min. didn't even need the sticky tape, works through her Otter Box Defender case. Just what I wanted This case has a low profile, and a sleek look. I llike it alot. It fits in my cellphone pocket on my shorts very easily. (Something that the &#34;OtterBox&#34; couldn't do.) It allows easy access to all the ports, and the buttons have great feedback. Good phone ! Worked great for about (4) months then just stopped... Very disappointing. I spent a little more on the replacement and it's still working perfect. I would never buy this cable again. I have used several sets of The Friendly Swede stylus packs, I have been very content with each and all of them.  This pack features a set of 3 quality styluses with 3 replaceable tips included (more are available online), tethers and a microfiber cleaning cloth.  Very handy set!  I like to use these in particular on my Galaxy Tab pro.  I received this set for reviewing purposes, they are quality made and I would buy at the current price listed when I need a stylus set. Got this for a friend. It does it's job. Very nice case This is a pretty good battery pack.  It works as it should and is able to charge my Galaxy S5 twice before running out of juice.  It is pretty small and I really like the flat USB cable that comes with it.  The carrying case it comes with is nice and very useful.  The only negative I have is that the battery pack arrived with a huge scratch on the top of it.  It doesn't affect me using it, but I wonder how it got there. Very good case. The protection is very good. Just a little rough on some of the edges. I used a file and feels much better. This is a nice case. Has a great fit and I feel confident in its protection. So why only (4) stars, well it got dirty really quick! I've never had that issue before and within two months, the red portion is visibly worn and dirty. It doesn't look how it's supposed to but it's still cute I was thrilled to get this external battery pack. I use it all the time. I thought I would just save it and use it for when the power went out but I find that I'm using it often as my phone uses energy quickly. I keep it with me in my purse at all times so I'm my battery gets low I just plug in my phone and I'm ready to go. This is a fantastic resource. It works great. This thing works really well for me when charging my iPhone but I have not been able to get it to charge my iPad, even in full, no-clouds, midday sun. I bought it for a camping trip and I look forward to using it but I'm glad I tested it first. I haven't tested it on multiple devices yet but I purchased this to use in my car stereo.  The VicTsing portable USB bluetooth receiver works for my purpose but there are some drawbacks.Pros:-Small-Gets power from USB-Comes with AUX cable-Audio is clear...no staticCons:-Volume is low.  Luckily I have an AUX volume booster but it's still lower than the CD/Radio. I tested the AUX directly with my phone and it's the same as CD/Radio.-No bass-Prompts to pair with my Note 3.My car provides always on power to the device and since there's no sync button, I have to unplug/replug in order for it to pair.  So, unless your USB port power turns off, you will have to unplug/replug this device to repair. Case took a while to ship but it is really cute. It fits my iPhone 5 phone perfectly. Warning though this case is just for show. It won't protect your phone if you drop it. Design is cute and it's fun :) The case is great protection and made to look great with the slim build of the LG G2. The cutouts are in the right places and this a plus considering the rear key on the back of the phone. I recommend this case as opposed to the case you'll pay more for at the Service Providers store. I bought one of the first one of these.  The sound is fantastic, but 8 months later, the solder connecting the audio input jack to the amplifier failed, and the unit no longer receives audio through the jack.  Sorry to tell, you this, I loved it while it lasted.  I assume bluetooth is still working, but I don't use that input.If you're handy with a soldering iron, it's not that hard to repair. I read other reviews, and those positive seem accurate. It's only been a few days that I've used it, but so far I am very pleased. I've charged it fully once, and yet  have to charge it again after using it for a few days (not continuously though). The sound quality is excellent for its size. It's quite heavy indicating it's constructed well, which also explains its sound quality. It connects easily with my cell phone, and conversations are clear. The control buttons (sound, volume, receiving and calling) work well. For the money, it's a good purchase. In fact I'm considering getting another one for my office. Good price, NEVER have connection problem. Been using them for a year now... Would buy again if necessary The process involves spraying a liquid that does not come contained in package-returned Works as expected. It is not worth wasting too much energy looking for something else to work wonders. Just get it. Great case as usual! I recommend! A strong an study case, just the right size, the cover is smooth and strong. This is a very good purchase. works great. Had this for my s4, loved it. Buttery smooth and finger print resistant. For my new note 3......garbage. No oleophobic coating whatsoever and after 4 days scratches began to appear. Not finger deep, but they definitely bug you! Had a Nilkin Nillkin H9??? Can't Remember if that's the correct name.... no oleophobic as well but it did have that resistance to scratches unlike this tech armor. This screen cover it's not worth your headaches. If you want a real solid product, buy the one from Verizon. It's twice the money, but it's thicker glass, which I have no problem using a spigen slim case. And it's got that smooth buttery glide for your finger and s pen. Nice phone case Cheaper than in the store and is made wonderfully! Very good price, it arrived on time and a perfect fit. Just what I needed it saved and protect my  smartphone. These cables are fantastic.  I feel they're much sturdier than plain vinyl cables, and they look awesome. I've purchased these twice now, and I'd buy them again.  They come in a nice little cardboard box you can repurpose for other stuff too. I highly recommend these. I think this battery is much better than the stock battery for my note 3 phone I planned buy a couple more these in the future. I would recommend this to my fellow Note 3 users. Absolutely love this case!!!!! Came super fast and is super bright. The pink is very bright and it shows off the teal beautifully. The only down side is it is a little thick so when I go to type it feels a bit odd. But I had my 20 yr old daughter use it and she said it felt fine to her (I'm 39 maybe I'm just too old lol). But I feel like my phone is very safe pin the case. I haven't dropped it yet but will update this when I do. The teal is a rubber sleeve that slips on the phone covering the entire back and sides. Then the hot pink pieces are hard plastic that snap on the front and back. All the needed ports are open but the rest is covered and I feel very secure about  y phone being I this case. I want to buy more like this!!!! This does the job.  It is capable but lacking.  It is NOT marked.  You do not know which is the high powered and low powered....The box shows that the higher powered plug is at the top which does have a little nob above it...so you know which way is up.....But how many of us will remember that when driving down the road and the kids in the backseat want to know which one is which.That is pretty big issue.I received a free sample. Cute but has a paper back very good and just as described. Cool design. Tight fit. The light changes red when charging then back to blue when its fully charged. It is short, however, if it were longer, 6' to 10', then it would've gotten a 5th star. Charges quick, like an OEM cable. Has done what it is suppose to do. No issues with it getting caught on SIM pins on the phone. Can be a bit tricky with some phones but I got the hang of it. These cards work great! I use it for a micro sim card into a full size sim and it functions flawlessly, I would recommend the SIM card adapters! thanks for making high quality products. Just purchased it and so far it is everything as advertised. Fits my s5 with no problem, works well with my Anker charge pad, charges through my Otter Box Defender case. It works great for charging in my smart phone. I read the reviews and was worried the light would be too much considering how I am not a heavy sleeper, and I love it. The light at the end is super dim, so when you open your eyes in the middle of the night, you'll only see a small dot. But when you need to connect the port to your phone, its SUPER helpful. I applied this item with the &#34;OMNI LED Light up Transparent Dual USB Port 3.1 AMP AC Travel Home Wall Charger Power Adapter (CLEAR)&#34; and it charged my phone SUPER fast. I mean, it usually takes 2-3 hours to charge my Samsung Galaxy S3, but this cord powered with the adapter is a match made in heaven. DEFF will be buying again. And the length? Its SOOO much more than I need, which is exactly what I need Works great but why's it only about 1 3rd the length of my original cable Finally, a screen protector that is resistant to fingerprints! Unfortunately, it still scratches up if carried in your pocket with keys or loose change, but that's what it is for, right? The anti-glare portion of the screen protector definitely reduces glare, but it also doesn't help you see a dim screen outside with brightness cranked up. It does its job. If I could give this less than a star, I would. I bought these from another website. The first pair I bought sounded like everything was coming through a tin can. I wrote and they sent me a second pair which are barely better than the first. I would only recommend these if you're going to be listening to spoken word, not actual music. Even the cheap wired pair I got at Dollar Tree sound better than these. The colored plastic band inside comes apart. They don't fit snug in your ears so wind noise gets in. They're uncomfortable after 5 minutes. They look like a bargain, THEY'RE NOT! Don't waste your money. Works perfectly I really like that case I have purchasex several units from Anker. They are very well made. They are packaged well. They are delivered very fast. I am very happy with everything I have purchased from Anker. Charging two phones and a tablet, all Androids all at the same time is a huge plus!!! Nice for the car just the right size for charging. Excelent Phone ! Best screen protector I've ever used. I buy one of these for every phone I get. I will never use another screen protector. They're ridiculously easy to put on, and if you somehow screw it up, just take it off and reapply, it's that easy. They even have a YouTube video you can watch to learn how to apply it. You won't be let down. 1st: Picture and what you get are different as another mentioned. These are for Nokia 900 & 920.2nd: the felt pad you clean the phone with sheds link, ok so you use the sticker to remove lint.NOPE! I installed all three covers and all had lint behind them. The felt pad sheds so much that link gets everywhere.3rd: because this is not made for a Nokia 1020, the sides are to wide. No matter how hard you try you will not get it to balance from side to side.Thanks Amazon for the refund. nice *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for OXA USA and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*Test devices:HTC OneHTC EVO 4G LTESamsung Galaxy S2Samsung Galaxy S3Samsung Galaxy S4Samsing Galaxy NexusiPad MiniiPad AirGoogle Nexus 7 (original)Tegra Note 7NVIDIA ShieldHere we are with yet another external battery product in the lipstick size category.  Let's be up front here, this product has but one thing going for it - price.  Currently it' s 11, even though OXA is shipping another product of the same capacity for a buck less.  The difference?  The other one has a keychain and no buttons.  Frankly, if it were me, I'd get the other one.  But let's look at this one, just because.  Metallic outer cover with a cheap plastic button and an LED hidden under another plastic cover.  What's the button for?  You have to press the button to turn the power on to your device.  Further, if you accidentally hit the button, because it's in your pocket, purse, or something, the LED comes on.  But guess what - it doesn't turn off until you press the button again.  This can lead to the battery getting drained, making the unit a useless weight.  That's just plain silly.  If it must use a button, then it should have an automatic off feature when it's not being used.  Better yet, ditch the button entirely and let the thing figure out when there is power draw or not like so many other products of this type do.  (Is it a surprise the other model I mentioned does that?).  The output is a bit disappointing.  First, it's supposed to be 1A.  The sticker on the bottom states it's 800mA, or, 0.800A.  So, which is it really?  Even at the 1A specification, 2A would be better.  Many new tablets, phones, and other devices use 2A input power, and the extra boosts how fast a device can charge.  Of the stack of external batteries I have, this OXA charges devices the slowest and depletes quickly compared to similar capacity units.  This causes me to question just how efficient the unit is, as it should give the same amount of charge.  I noted other reviewers state that their units broke down after a few uses, which doesn't surprise me.  I've had this one since March, used it quite a few times for testing, and it's still going strong.  This alone is the reason I rate it as an Ok product, that it actually works. This is (obviously) a gadget for the frequent traveler. Sliding or pressing the little slider control selects one of the three different prong configurations. The USA / AUS / NZ are the same one - the prongs rotate a little to accommodate.This is a simple solution to a traveler's dilemma - charging you USD devices while in other countries - or even in the USA.There are two USB charging ports, each over 2 amps - so even your power hungry tablet will fill up quickly.I gave this four stars because it looks and feels a little cheap.  I'm sure the quality is there - it worked fine when I used it. But the slider that controls the entire thing is a weak point. Seems to charge faster than other car chargers we have used. Which is really the main thing. The only negative is that the whole unit often pops out when trying to disengage the phone. You need to make sure it is secure or brace it a little when removing the phone. But it works very well and recommended. This is a super affordable way to get the iPhone 5 the battery power that Apple should have given it to begin with. The iPhone 5 is super useful but it's a resource hog. The phone was made to sell, and customers liked the small profile and weight, not knowing they'd have to attach a battery cover if they want to use the phone much.This battery cover doesn't weigh much at all nor does it take much volume. It truly boggles the mind that one can't get a new iPhone with sufficient power. For the price, this deal is great - it more than doubles the power of the iPhone 5.As for safety in terms of protecting the iPhone from bumps, I think the battery cover gives only a little extra safety. It might absorb the energy of a fall and come apart in the process. That's better than permanently ruining the phone, and one can put the battery case back on and keep going. The price of this battery cover is very favorable at the moment. Battery cover provided by 1Byone. Disappointed with this item. It automatically takes up both plug slots whether you put it in the top or bottom slot which sort of defeats the point of having a multi-port device. Great sounding... touch sensitive controls -- really is what you want to read when you are looking to buy a bluetooth speakerphone.  I've used quite a few that were a bit more portable from Plantronics and Jabra, but I've found the quality in this larger unit to be worth the bulk.  At no time in using this after about 20-30 calls have I had anyone ask me: &#34;am I on a speaker phone?&#34;This speaker was designed to reproduce voices very clearly - and on my granite top desk, the sound fills the room without feeding back into my conference calls.  The bluetooth is easy to pair -- and I've tried the NFC setup, but I'm not as familiar with that technology as bluetooth, so my interest left me after trying to find the settings in my phone's menus for a few minutes.  NFC may be very cool, but apparently its not as easy as pairing a bluetooth.  I didn't remove any stars for this complexity - since its probably my unfamiliarity.  I didnt get it for the NFC - so if that's a requirement, you may wish to look into other reviews for that functional information.The touch controls are ingenious...  for example.  why would you want a traditional button on a microphone, the noise would just transmit through the line.  The touch controls make no sound when used -- perfect.  In addition to conference calls, I've used this as an audiobook speaker - which benefits from the tweaks to make voice sound great.  I'm not sure its a good companion for music if you are an audiophile, but great for audiobooks.Size...  It's not easy to put into a briefcase... this is portable, but bulky.  I will leave it on my desktop and move it around my office to be on a meeting table versus a desk, but its not likely to leave the building. It is amazing to track the progress of Bluetooth speakers. I have some from a few years ago that could produce sound from an amazing few feet from a computer and sounded as if the sound were coming out a cardboard oatmeal container.The Spracht Conference Mate is four inches square, offers incredible Bluetooth reception, has reasonably good quality audio output and is muscularly loud. It is extremely versatile and will accept standard Bluetooth from any device, NFC from a properly equipped mobile device and audio through a cable with a 3.5mm jack.Operation is very simple. Plug it into a USB port or AC adapter to charge the Lithium-Ion battery. Switch the Conference Mate into pairing mode, pair it with your device, return the switch to the middle (power) position and you&#8217;re ready to roll. The instructions are clear and concise.The playback sound quality and volume of this unit is very impressive. At top volume, the audio is easily  listenable throughout the living / dining / kitchen area of my unit. I am not an audiophile and am fairly uncritical of audio fidelity. The Conference Mate&#8217;s audio was clear, crisp, with little distortion at the top setting. There isn&#8217;t much aside the center range: treble and bass are present, but the bass isn&#8217;t going to rattle the walls and the treble will not shatter glass.The Bluetooth range is something else. I&#8217;m able to carry this little device to the furthest reaches of our unit with several intervening walls and it worked very well. Better, in fact, than any of the other Bluetooth devices I own.I don&#8217;t have much experience, however, with the conference features. They work. Parties on the other side say they can hear and understand my audio fine. Typically I use a headset for calls and rarely, if ever, have a need for a true conferencing system in one location. It seems to work is the best and most I can say here.At 4 x 4 inches, the unit is a bit larger than I would travel with, but that&#8217;s strictly my personal preference. In terms of weight, it sure doesn&#8217;t represent an issue.Overall, if I were compelled to offer a one-word review, I think it would be &#8220;slick&#8221;.Jerry This is a pretty decent speaker. We've been using it for a few weeks, mainly to listen to music and watch TV shows paired with our iPad & iPhone. However, we have used it to Skype with Grandma and Grandpa and it's fantastic for our simplistic needs.Pairing was easy, even with our Mac computer. Sometimes I have trouble pairing it with my iPhone. It takes a couple tries. This probably has more to do with my phone. Even still, my troubles only take about 10 -15 seconds on a bad day.Speaker is on the bottom of the Conference Mate, and it's not covered, not even with a little mesh. Need to be careful with it.Sound quality is decent. It's a small speaker and does pretty good sound quality, but remember this is not a stereo system. It's more for recreational use, sitting around a quiet room. If you take it outside you'll probably loose sound.Overall it's a good little system with multiple uses. Small and compact, it's easy to put in a travel bag. It's also well designed and looks cool! Great speakerphone for the price -- good voice quality and not bad for music either. Paired easily and controls are well laid out and intuitive. Another iPhone case I've been trying out... the CrystalShield iPhone 5/5S Clear Hard Shell Case provides good protection for the sides and back of my iPhone, but it isn't something I'd count on for screen protection.The CrystalShield case is very light-weight, and it's easy to get on and off of my iPhone. The top and bottom edges are open, so getting a grip on the phone to remove it from the case isn't as hard as some other cases can be. The openings on the sides for the buttons are accurately placed, so no problems there. In normal use, I almost forget that I even have case on the phone.In terms of screen protection, there's basically none. The lip around the open edges of the case is minimal, and there's nothing that would keep things from scratching the screen during a fall. I'd use this case mainly as a way to keep the body of my iPhone looking nice. For screen protection, I'd look for something different.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free I have an iPhone in an Otterbox case. I put the piece of metal inside the case and it stuck to the mount but it doesn't feel too secure. Since it hasn't fallen off, I guess it's more my opinion than actual fact. I tired both pieces of metal provide with same result. Which brings up a point that I do like that they provide two metal pieces -- one with adhesive and one without. This case does the job of adding additional battery to your phone, which is what I wanted it to do, but there are a number of issues with it that detract a good bit.#1: This device will, from time to time, tell you that the accessory is not supported, while charging. This is indicative of the device being not certified , or able to work fully with the iPhone.#2: This device, while advertising as a  'protective case' is not so much. All it will take is dropping your phone on it's face to actually cause the device to crack. The bumpers don't give an ounce of protection to the actual phone in and of itself.#3: Taking the bumper off , after it's already placed on there, is just a nightmare.I love the theory of this product, but the reality is that it is just not ready for prime time by any means Great screen. Beautiful, SUPER thin, functional. Only down side is the price. Although I am satisfied, I would not pay this price again. Definitely a solid, high quality and high performing product. Just very expensive (Cost more than my case).Also, 100% user error... when I installed it (which was very simple) a speck of dust got between the glass and the glass protector and now it is forever there... and I think the applied pressure from forcing out air bubbles may have permanently damaged the screen on my phone. Like I said, 100% user error.. but it is what it is. Seriously great case... its not heavy or bulky. The styling and design is gorgeous. I can honestly say I love the way it looks. The buttons are perfectly ergonomic providing feedback when pushed. I've dropped my phone twice since having the case and performance is as expected. The USB port is also designed well, with a wide enough opening to accommodate after-market mini-usb+mini-hdmi cables.Bottom line: Slim case, great fit and even better finish. Oh and cannot beat that price!!! Works great, saved my phone a couple of times already and is easy to go on and off. This is my first Spigen case and I must say, it is a great case. It holds the phone tight and the case truly is slim. I have removed the phone a couple of times to clean it up but the Spigen Slim Armor case hasn't let any dust get by to scratch up the trim around the edge of the phone. If you want a case that is not bulk and provides good protection, get the Spigen Slim Armor case. Not a bad little tripod and adapter.The tripod is very flexible and versatile, and the clamp holds a camera or phone pretty well.The only flaw I found was that the over-sized ball joint arrangement turned out very top-heavy with a phone installed. One has to be very careful how one places the tripod legs and arranges the phone to keep it from falling over. If not for that, it would be a 4 star item. It could be a 5 star item if the vendor figured out a better ball joint to avoid this problem, and did it well.For very light weight items, it would work better. I used a medium sized (under 4 inch screen) smart phone, and the weight of event that average phone caused issues.With that caveat in mind, the construction is good, the mechanisms work reasonably well (although there was one point of attachment I couldn't quite get to lock down), and the clamp does hold your gear solidly. These replacement backs for my note3 are great  . I have an ultra clear tpu case over it for added grip . my only issue is that it says bubblepack on the bottom right but no big deal . These compact and affordable headphones are great for listening to podcasts, or audio books, or hands free calls. They sound ok for music streaming. Not much for low range bass or higher range highs when it comes to music. Not much noise cancelation either. What I like, no wires! easy to pair, clear stereo sound, compact design.What I don't like: 300 mAh battery means about an hour of listening or so, not much for bass or highs, noise cancelation is weak. Like all MPOW devices shows up as MPOW on my Bluetooth listing, multiple MPOW devices makes this confusing. Should use a model# or something on each one. No carry case provided, it would be a nice touch for a foldable designed headphone.Overall for $35 these are a good headphone, I was able to do hands free calling with them via BlueTooth 4.0. AAC aptX codec support for stereo sound. I'd keep to podcasts or audio books with these or light music listening. Not for the hardcore audiophile. But I would hope not for $35. Works as advertised and I've had no issues but the head is too large for certain devices.  Truly a shame too since it's so nice to have visual confirmation of charge status from across the room.  Hopefully they will update the next version with a smaller head. First off, this case looks amazing. I bought mine in black. It fits well and the phone feels very secure.However, the case has several very annoying flaws:1. This case is slippery! Just like a naked, careless M8, the case is hard to hold onto with one hand. And slides down any surface with even a slight angle.2. They may as well have built it without an opening for the USB port. I've tried 5 different cables and none have been able to get far enough into the port to charge the phone. I have to remove the case to charge the phone.3. Immediately after putting on the first part of the case, the power button was being held in by the case itself. The phone would constantly give me the power-down menu, and take a screen shot if I ever pressed the home button. After some adjustment, I was able to stop this behavior but it still comes back sometimes.Again, this case looks great and I do not doubt it's security, but I hate using it because of this case's very fatal flaws. The case works great.  Does no make my girlfriends phone too bulky.  Still fits in her purse and she loves the color. Cable works great, i dont have to be stuck to the wall to use my phone while charging. It charges really fast. I bought the case, installed it and really liked it until I couldn't stand the finger prints and dust that would collect on the built-in screen protector.  After a month, I couldn't stand it and started looking if I could swap out the built-in protector with a better alternative.  I took it apart and after looking at other available alternatives, I found that there is isn't a replacement that will fit inside the protective case front.  This is a real pity as I really liked the protection that the case offered.I bought another Supcase but without the built-in protective screen and was able to purchase a screen protector that is smudge proof and doesn't collect dust.  I also found that the new screen is noticeably more sensitive. Good case and fits well. Just have to careful not to scratch it inserting the phone. I find that out with m7. Good enough case I bought for m8. The arrived as said, and the fit to the T. So far I've used only one but seems to work perfectly fine. I would buy them again, and definitely recommend them. I have a Samsung 5s. The HAVIT HV-S452BT external speaker is Bluetooth enabled device that delivers good quality sound, for its diminutive size.  The speaker can be connected via Bluetooth, or hard wired using a standard 1/8 audio connection.  Like many portable Bluetooth speakers, this unit can be paired with a cell phone, and used to carry on a conversation.The rechargeable batteries are rated for four hours (minimum), for music playback, and up to seven hours for phone conversations.  The HV-S452BT has a set of buttons located at the base of the unit, which provide pretty comprehensive control.  Volume can be raised and lowered, you can skip tracks forward and back, and playback can be paused to take a call.  A micro-USB port for recharging, and a 1/8 line in jack, are also located at the base.The cylindrical outer housing appears to be of made primarily of aluminum, which makes the unit extremely tough, but still light in weight.  The speaker has smooth plastic on its underside, and could probably use some rubber pads to keep it from sliding.The speaker is directed upward, which produces a type of sound that is pleasing to some.  The unit is capable of producing a pretty decent level of sound, without too much distortion.  You won't get a lot of bass, but that's rather typical for speakers for this size, which are probably adequate for a smaller room.A sample was provided for evaluation.  While I do prefer the sound from speakers that are positioned vertically, if you do like the sound directed upwards, these speakers would not be a bad choice, as long as you are not looking to provide coverage for a large space.  Build quality appears to be very good, and the unit has a nice set of control buttons.  Included accessories include a USB/micro-USB cord for recharging, and 1/8 audio in patch cord for hard wire connection. This is a great product as usual from iSmooth!  The package comes with three screen protectors, although the first one worked just fine.  The referenced video is helpful and will improve your results.  I ended up with one tiny bubble, but am overall impressed with the quality of the protector, and the dust tabs made them quite easy to apply correctly...a high value product! These screen protectors are perfectly made for the note 3. All the cutouts line up perfectly and the home button is enclosed (cutout all the way around) unlike some other protectors. I have no problem using the stylus on the protector (also unlike some others I've read about). It's the most invisible protector you can get. Plus the company has amazing customer service, with a guarantee that if you mess up all 3 protectors when applying, they'll send you a new one. That's a pretty good deal! Great product, great company. Recommend! Works well with my phone but not with many cases. I was able to fit it on my I-Blason case (a bit of a squeeze). Works great so far and holds a charge for a long time. Let me begin by saying how SURPRISED I am! I needed a two port usb charger and I found this on accident. It looked cool enough, so I basically bought it. Didn't read the reviews, nothing. Just clicked. I received it literally two days later. Plug it in, the lights feature is cool. Great for a nightlight if you're afraid of the dark like me, but you will need a mask to block out the light. Anyways, I plugged this in with the &#34;9.8 ft LED Light Up Micro USB Cable&#34; and my Samsung Galaxy S3 charged so fast, I was impressed. What usually takes over two-three hours to charge my phone, happened in an hour. I love this item, and I WILL purchase again, once I make a few payments on my credit card, haha. Must have! Don't hesitate. Get it. This has been the most fun selfie we had with us on vacation this year.  Everyone who saw our group using it wanted one!!!  We hooked it up on the screw at the bottom to my camera - put it on 10 second delay and we had a bunch of selfies of our whole group of 6.  This was the highlight of our vacation as the whole group kept saying!!!  I did have to adjust the screw at the top occasionally when using it a lot.  Just make sure it is tight at all times and you will have a lot of fun! This tablet is bare bones when it comes to features.  It runs android kit Kat, but it doesn't even support features like USB on the go, which has been around since '01.  The 1 GB of RAM isn't enough frankly, video and games lag.  The WiFi constantly needs to be refreshed because it loses connection.  Finally tuye cameras are junk, and the screen resolution is really only good for light web browsing.  In fact as I am typing this, the text box is fritzing out blinking black, and then showing me the text at random... ... I am getting rid of this thing and getting something better. I have three different Arm Band ones, this is by far the best of the three, but not without its problems.Pros:-There was a similar but different armband that I found that was same price but charged you extra for the arm extender, this comes with it-I tried it with my fattest case (which isn't defender thick, but still thick) and it went in rather easily-fits my arm fine, not extremely big, but big enough that most arm bands barely work with it without cutting off circulationCons:-The padding is pretty much non-existent-The build quality is slightly questionable, the stitches seem strong, but there is an odd flimsiness to it that you have to have in your hand. There was an odd piece of thread that spanned the opening where the phone slips in, couldn't tell if it was intentional or if an overlook.-There isn't a zipper to hold the phone in place, but it is made well enough that it feels like the phone can't and won't slip out, and if you have a silicon case on your phone then its darn near impossible for it to slip out. Though that flap design also makes it difficult to maneuver the phone into the sleeve.-Since this had fat cases in mind the vinyl view window is very loose even with my fattest case on so it makes using the touch screen hard to use at times. Bought it for my wife who not only wears it to exercise but around the house while working. Love the warranty We received two armband cases from Gear Beast, this one for the Samsung Galaxy SIII and another for the iPhone 5c (Gear Beast Case Compatible Sports Armband for Otterbox Commuter / Defender Cases for Apple iPhone 5 /5s / 5c / iPhone 4 / 4s and more (Blue)).This armband style case is soft, easy to put on, and stays in place while exercising. The headphone port is accessible while in use, and the case does not obstruct screen vision. Simple, effective design for use during exercise and, though sized for those with Otterbox protection on their phone, it works fairly well if you have a similarly large non-Otterbox case too. Recommended.Our volleyball playing son has a regular exercise routine and has been looking for an armband case like this. Other cases he has tried have been too 'hard' or edgy; just not comfortable for him, or their edges have created irritation. This one is made of a soft material that is smooth and comfortable for use.He does not have an Otterbox case, preferring to use another brand that is about as large, and the fit is OK. At first he tried the S3 without a case at all, and that was not acceptable (the case is not made to adjust to the smaller size and the phone just bounced around). Then he put his other case on and the fit was much better; too bad that there is no way to really make a fitment adjustment for variance in case size.The Amazon sales page notes that this armband includes a Gear Beast Lifetime Hassle Free Warranty, so if an issue arises I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this armband case gratis from the seller and put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for an S3 armband case of this material, style, size, and price, for use as I have described above, based on our son's experience with this one we would certainly say give it a try.Go for it! The little apps work fine but I basically bought it for my workouts. The heart rate monitor rarely works, at a stand still my heart rate reads 160bpm, running it reads 0. Not happy with that aspect of this watch. Great for my runs and bike rides, fits comfortably on my arm.  I've tried other armbands similar to this and they either pinched my skin or because of the material made my arm itchy and left a red mark after a long ride.  This works great and so far no issues at all.  Even got it a little wet while riding and it started to rain and no issues. This is a really good start, but it doesn't have everything it needs to be. I'm rating it based mainly on the fact that the hardware is very nice, and the company is obviously working on improving it so I'm expecting that the places where the software falls short will improve over time.Good points:It looks really nice. The quality of the LED screen seems very good, and the touch interface works nicely. I've had no problems with getting it to recognize me. This is a device that will look perfectly lovely sitting on a shelf and displaying some photos while it also stores them for you.It's also nice the the apps back everything up smoothly and don't require a lot of fuss. It didn't take me long to get up and running.Bad points:This isn't really a secure way to back things up, because they haven't supplied a tool that makes it easy to back up the contents of the LyveHome itself (at least, not that I could find). That makes this a project that encourages people to load all of their photos and videos onto one drive... where all of them will be permanently lost if that drive should crash or fail. They need some kind of really easy option to back up the contents to another device. If I still have to keep files on my phone or back them up separately from my phone to my computer, this isn't helping me out as much as it should.I also have this vague, maybe slightly paranoid, concern about what's going to happen one day when someone takes a photo they do NOT want to share. Then, they don't remember that it's there before their phone sends it to the LyveHome where the device automatically starts scrolling the photo along with the others over it's lovely little LED screen. I'm just picturing Grandma and Grandpa visiting down in the living room with the parents when a teenager is taking a topless photo or something. That's not the device's fault, but err... before you turn on the use my photos as a screen saver option, do think about whether you REALLY want your photos to be your screen saver?They also need to work on some significant improvements to your ability to organize, move around, and delete photos. When you're putting 2TB of photo and video on one drive, you need to be able to sort through it and manage it somehow.On the whole, this is a piece of hardware that seems to have received a lot of time and attention. The app that goes with it has a nice clean design so far, though the features need to be improved. This is the basis of a potentially really nice product, but I probably would wait a couple of months to let them do software updates and make improvements.And this last bit should be obvious, but I'll also add that it's far less expensive to back up your photos to a separate drive if you buy something that's just a drive and isn't designed with so much concern about looking nice, or things like LED screens. A 2TB external drive could do a similar job for a lot less money, but I'm sure a lot of people will want this instead because having the cute little photo scroll on the front is a nice touch and it really does look good. So far I will give it 5 stars.  It charges as fast at my wall outlet and seems to be durable.  I have already suggested this to two other friends who have purchased it. This Case Logic Samsung Galaxy 2 Piece Red & Black case is sturdy and fashionable.  It allows for an easy and secure grip on the cell phone and also provides maximum protection in case the cell is dropped.  It is unisex. This dash mount is a great way to keep your phone in arms reach.The design and functionality of the device is simple but very effective. The dash mount does a great job and has the ability to accept a wide range of cell phones.The jaws can be extended to firmly hold some of the biggest phones on the market. The inside of the grippers have a rubber insert, which helps hold the phone. Also, there is a slot that helps to minimize your phone moving and ensure it is held in place. There is a Ball & Socket joint that allows the phone to be positioned in the best viewable angle, even landscape mode.The mount will easily affix to the dash via a suction cup with a super tacky gel pad made by 3M, who makes great adhesives. The jaws are firmly kept close with an exterior black spring. Once your mount is in place, just insert your phone for the best viewing angle.I knew this was a great mount, since it was able to accommodate the large size of my Note 2. It works great when you are using your phone as a GPS to reach your destination.If the suction cup is not holding as good as it once was. All you have to do is rinse it with water, let air dry, and it will be just as good as new.FEATURES:Phone Holding Size: 1.5 - 3.5in (38.1 - 88.9mm)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review. This is a fantastic portable charging cable. Long enough so that you can still manipulate your phone while charging but short enough that it can't get tangled. Undoubtedly, this had got to be one of the most stylish set of earbuds I&#8217;ve ever tried out.  The design is eye-popping and definitely will get some notice.  Pairing the Swage U headphones had to be the easiest, most seamless Bluetooth connection I&#8217;ve ever tried.  No hesitation and I was good to go within a minute trying out different genres of music.What I immediately noticed was the clarity and decent soundstage.  These aren&#8217;t &#8220;loud,&#8221; but most earbuds these days tend to stray away from blowing out the old eardrums.  The controls, which are very clearly marked, became easier to work with.  The volume and call connect buttons are on one side which the skip track are on the other.  Give it to Rokit Boost to create a workable, functional design.The unusual design provides a lot of comfort.  You have more power, power that rests behind the ears.  The earbuds pull out for an easy, comfortable listening experience.  Musically the range was good, but if I were to purchase the Swage U earbuds, I&#8217;d definitely select them to listen to e-books or You-Tube videos.If you&#8217;re an audiophile, you&#8217;ll be heading on up to the higher priced earbuds, but for the casual listener, the price point is right and the sound good.  There are extra earbuds in the package, a feature I like.  I also like the decent Bluetooth range, and the long playing time.FEATURES:&#9658;  Premium comfort with lightweight and trouble-free, wearable design Bluetooth Headphones&#9658;  Magnetic ear buds and careful headset design for easy wearing&#9658;  Reliable wireless pairing provided by Bluetooth Version 4.0 technology&#9658;  Built-in microphone for easy, hands-free communication, Great Microphone sound&#9658;  8 hours playback time. 100 hours standby timeSPECS:&#9658;  Bluetooth version:  V4.0&#9658;  Support agreement: HSP V1.2, HFP V1.6, A2DP&#9658;  Operation distance:  10m&#9658;  Range of requency: 2.4G to 2.4835GHz ISM band&#9658;  Supports 2 mobile phones at the same time&#9658;  Supports APTX audio condec solutionSample provided for review. Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest reviewThis is a sturdy, efficient, and compact USB charger that does in fact work great on the desktop due to its small size, and does actually charge anything that charges via USB as it is suppoed to. There does seem to be a max output, so be aware of that. You wont be able to charge 4 tablets at the same time (or rather, you could, but it wont be quick), but you could charge 2 tablets and 2 lower output items reasonably efficiently. In fact, this does charge items rather quickly. That's pretty much it....it is a no frills, effective device. It isnt the best charger I have used, but it is rally good, and I can easily recommend it. Place it in the shower and stream your tunes.  As we all know....we sound good in the shower.I however like this better on the boat.  Place it on the windshield and you have your own personal speaker.It really does have a good sound to it.  Since I got it for free for writing this review I decided to test it out.Recipe: Take one urge basics and drop it into one bag of fish. Leave it in water for a few minutes.  I took it out and did let it dry out for about half an hour.Place back on windshield.  Guess what.  It still worked.  So it is water resistant/repellant.  amazing little thing. Plantronics BackBeat FIT wireless headphones have accomplished what other wireless headphones couldn't - they fit a small head/ears, are comfortable & stay in place!Syncing to my Windows phone was easy and the sound was clear (I can still hear street noise).  The only problem I had was with the buttons, which are small. I also had a problem with the diagram & labeling, but once I figured out the buttons (the diagram didn't help much), the headphones were easy to use.The case is nice in that it turns inside out to make an armband for my Windows Lumia phone (which stays in place). Charging is pretty quick & the battery life is very good.  I did not try to make/take phone calls, so cannot comment on this feature.Because of the fit, these are my go-to headphones. Sometimes just having a charger cable for your phone or tablet just doesn't cut it. You aren't always near a wall socket or something else that can charge it, and if there's an emergency or you need to get something done, the situation seems hopeless. With a reliable external battery though, you're all set, and that's exactly what the Lifecharge Juicypack is. This is the first external battery I've used, and I've been impressed with how it's performed so far. The only device I've used with it is my Samsung S4 Mini, which went from 8% to 100% in a little over two hours. That's a huge difference from when I charge it through my computer, that's for sure.I'll be honest and tell you right now that I don't understand what all the numbers associated with this thing stand for. 16800mAh seems to be at the top of its game though. The charger features two USB ports: 1amp and 2.1amp. According to the instructions, one's for tablets and the other's for phones. Between the ports is a micro USB cable port for you to charge the unit itself. Also included on the same side as the ports is a little LED flashlight, activated by pressing the power button twice. It's not that strong, but still has its use like trying to find ports on a computer in a dark area or something.The LED display on the charger is great, and shows you how much power is left in the unit. This thing takes a while to charge. Right out of the box it was at 68%. I had it charging through a computer for 2 hours and saw that it was at 75%. Fully charging it once it's reached zero is going to take some time.Size-wise, the Juicypack is great. It's just 12 ounces, and isn't much bigger than the average phone. It's well-built and solid. The only concern I have is that mine was brand new, yet had scuffs all over the metallic border around the LED display. Maybe I just somehow got a refurbished one? It's also worth noting that you'll get over 500 recharge cycles with the unit. It might not sound like -that- much, but it's more than enough since, if you're like most people, you'll be charging your device the regular way. Don't use this just because it's convenient!All in all, I highly recommend this battery to anyone who's going to be going on a trip somewhere as an emergency backup option, or just to have in your car just in case. It's just a few bucks more than the standard version that doesn't have the display screen, so why not spend the extra money? This  screen protector works greatIt was very easy to apply ,fits great ...no  bubbles.....all I wanted  and more ....no more oily prints on my screen now...........shipping was very fast with my Amazon prime ,arrived packed well...... Not OEM, cheap knockoff Purchased it for the long length. Very happy. Wonderful slim fit phone case! I love the translucent rainbow colors, it like the glow. Absolutely beautiful case that will get noticed wherever you are! I really like it becasue it works well with my Life Proof case. I do not have to remove the case to charge my phone. Had this for several months now. This has excellent signal & super long battery. My iPhone & android pick up/memorize its signal at all times. I use these for outdoor exercising ((not a good idea coz the headphone cushions are very sensitive. I hope they sell replacement cushions. If not, then using these while you sweat is a bad idea. Other than that I have zero complaints! I bought 2 of these, the other one is made by a different manufacturer. They both are well made, the FRIEQ case has a thicker grade of plastic. I plan to use this one the most and have the other as a spare. I haven't used it much but haven't had any Problems. Sound quality is great, headphones are really very comfortable.I use them to watch movies on my laptop, my husband uses them for playing games on the computer and we are both very satisfied. Headphones rest very comfy on your head and lay tightly around your ears, making it easy to wear them for a long period of time. Loved it&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039; Even cuter than the picture & fits perfect I love the tylt Mic-Bandbl- T Band. It was all as advertised & works really well. Plus it looks really good. It's good quality & I would highly recommend it. So cute! This battery pack works great,  it's one of the best purchases I've made in awhile.  It really packs a lot of juice and is able to charge my phone and tablet several times before needing to be recharged. It came with a nice pouch and several short charging cables to charge my devices,  really great product and a great deal. The good:This phone case does NOT have the feature that puts the phone to sleep when you close it.  Many like the feature, I hate it.  I tend to fold my phone case behind the phone while using it and other cases would put the phone into sleep mode when I do this.  This one doesn't.It keeps your cards in place - they don't fall out.The bad:Like many cases, if you take the phone out of the case (I like to switch out batteries instead of having to charge the phone), the plastic will break rendering the case useless. I've had this about 2 weeks and there's already a crack and I've only removed the phone 2 or 3 times. I did not like this case. It damages easily and shows scratches from minor wear and tear. I used it less than a month and switched cases because the buttons were so much tougher to push than my TPU case. I do not recommend this case. I put these on all my phones and tablets. They go on easier than other screen protectors and never have the bubbles, etc. either. Best screen protectors I have tried The iSmooth Screen Protectors work great to protect the screen on my Galaxy S4. They are easy to install. I got it perfect on the first try. It comes with 3 so if you fail you can try again. It comes with a few accessories so it is easy to install. It has a lifetime warranty in case anything happens. I high recommend these screen protectors!I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, for free to keep, and I promised that my review is fair and honest. This is so cool - I love it Phone fits in it with my slim case. Quality seems good and all buttons, etc., are accessible. Giving 3 stars because it just won't fit around my arm. I am a 6'3&#34; guy, but I am nit that muscular yet...if you are a tall guy, this one is not for you.. sent back, not a good buy Good case, buttons work very well, but the hole for the charging port is quite small and I have trouble opening the flap on the S5 for the charging port. It's Great. As good or better than the one that came with my phone. It was Fully charged when I received it. I liked that.! The battery its very good, sound very good and easy to use. Throw the headphones are not good. its a good headset.  The only con I have is the control is just a bit too close to the earpiece,  that makes it harder to find when I'm riding my bike  Other than that I love it. I purchased this for its durable Microfiber tip and pen on opposite side. While the Microfiber top is better than most I've owned, the pen mechanism is &#34;so-so&#34;. Can't beat the price though. I'd purchase it again if needed to. This is the second set of screen protectors I've bought from IllumiShield for 2 different phones. These are the smoothest and best fitting screen protectors I've ever had. They feel just like glass and offer great protection. Just received this today and it's not too bad. Just a few little things...the card slots are a little loose. So you can fit two cards in each slot but if you put two in all of them then the case doesn't close right. So I'm a little afraid they will fall out. Also the magnet flip doesn't fold back when the case is open. But the back of the case has a magnet so it works well when open.  There is a little hook for a wristlet but it doesn't come will it. (It didn't advertise that it did so no big deal). It fits my galaxy s5 pretty good. Not perfect but I don't think it will fall out. Also I got the pink and white one and after feeling the materiel I know the white is going to get filthy wish I would've gotten the Blue one. Overall for the price not bad at all. I installed it quickly.  I was skeptical of the suction mount, but it's held up for a week now with no sign of letting go.  My only goal was to prop the phone up for Google Maps navigation or speakerphone conversations...... but then I noticed that the camera is always pointing right down the road, and so I looked and sure enough there are fully functioning free dashcam apps on the Android market (I use Autoboy) that record video in the background when it detects your car's bluetooth, and auto-deletes the oldest footage like a DVR..  Sweet!  I got an auto-starting dash cam for $12! I got this for my friend and she loved it So far, so good.  It does everything as described, with no issues for my Galaxy S5.  I will post an update if it fails later.Be sure you are buying from an Official Samsung product. Great deal came fast you can never have to many chargers. Great price I would order! So I ended up ordering this screen protector based on good reviews, but by accident ordered frosted anti-glare version that is just terrible. Then I ordered clear version that was not bad, but attracted quite a bit of fingerprints. In the end I ended up getting glass screen protector that also came with lens protectors. After using this for a couple days I can honestly say this is the best money I've spent. The pack shows how much battery is left just by shaking it, which is the easiest I've ever seen. Don't worry the dial that shows you how much is left used miniscule power, or as it says in the manual it would take 1,000,000 shakes to use up the battery.Having three charging ports is great when I travel with an iphone and an iPad.12,000 mAh is a phenomenal amount if battery power that lasts through multiple charging cycles of my devices, and since it lives in my backpack and doesn't get used everyday the battery should last me a while before it requires a recharge.My only wish, and this is for ANY addon device, would be to have a lightning plug input option for charging so that I don't have to carry around a micro USB and my iphone lightning cable. Great case love it great price love the color came fast holds my phone good and love the way it looks Loved it&#10084;&#65039;&#10084;&#65039; Great deal great price came fast. easy to put on and stays on good. love the way you can't even see it. keeps my screen safe Love it I really like this sound bar.  It fills the room with quality sound.  The mid-range and highs are clear and compare favorably to my center channel off of another rooms home theater.  I used the &#34;Sub Out&#34; port to pair this with a spare 10&#34; subwoofer I had and I must say the two do beautifully together considering the price.  There are a total of five inputs to allow for direct connections to A/V components if you wish.  Honestly the only complaint I have is the fact that using a digital input (Optical TOSLINK) from the TV causes the sound bar to go silent and start flashing sometimes if the channel is changed or the sound goes silent for a couple of seconds.  This doesn't happen on analog inputs so I'm a little baffled.  And I don't mind using analog connections though I'm sure some users may care.  But all in all, for the price, I think this bar is an excellent value,  and great addition to any room that isn't suited or intended as a home theater. ok i own ipad 2..nexus 7 and galaxy s3 with a windows 8 laptop  i bought this phone cuz of the hype surrounding os platform..with all the devices i own the 521 is a great starter phone for newbies but also for those like me who like to play around with inexpensive tech like the 521 the phone is practical though and through..when and if u buy this phone back up ur sim card contacts to the sim and sd card,,then put both in phone,,boot up,,then do a factory reset...this will help with google mail and ur other google accounts..i had probs with this and so i did just that and it solved the prob..now to the meat of the phone..windows 8 flows flawlessly on the 521..no lag and i found all kinds of neat hidden features through messing around with the phone as well as  internet...8.1 is coming tmo news says it is so does nokia...and all the internet does...the hardware specs work on this phone better than u might think the os is fast responsive and best yet unclutterd  hooray microsoft..but we all know if u wait and see what people want u kinda copy others but with a different pizzaz..microsoft and apple have done this bikering over the years but wait theres more...this phone is great for your teens..because parents can monitor from any windows ..apple..or android os by simply using your microsoft account or apple or  android sytem with your email and monitor location content and contacts by simply becoming an administrater(the one who is in charge,parents) you can get help and tips on the internet..i would buy three more just to have them for presents..also bought one for a cousin in england,, and it works there too...buy buy buy!!!! Great invention, will be using it for recharging my iPhone and iPad. works great comes in handy get comments from people if I'm using it at a dinner people want to know where I got it price etc.. If you want/need a screen protector for your note 3 then this is the one to get.. Period. In fact, it feels better and wrights better than the &#34;real&#34; screen. Installation is dead simple and 5 minutes start to finish to using your phone. Instructions are clear and concise. Could not be happier! work great. thick seems that it will protected from scratches. the only thing its little hard to install the screen proctor it take time patient and practice. I got the frost case. It fits nice and sung for my s4 mini. The frost case is like a clear version of the case-- which is very nice if you have the white s4 mini. None of the ports or the buttons are covered by the case. Easy to grip. Beautiful case. Good price. LOVE IT  came fast love the color keeps my phone safe and love the hello kitty great price I would buy it great deal Good I have had cell phones for a long time and this is the first time I have ever cracked a screen.  It happened when my recliner &#34;ate&#34; my phone and end up pinching the side.  I am normally not that hard on my phone and as I am a little tech savy I decided to change my phone myself.  The instructions provided were good and the tools helped out.  The most difficult part is trying to get the current's phone's glass to start to remove after that it is easy.  One thing I would say with the instructions is that you it doesnt mention what the entire glass looks like.  I started remove the glass however you have also remove the backside which is beyond the blue samsung plate as well.  After I removed that I was able to replace the glass.  The reason why I gave this kit 3 stars is because the glass lasted a week and a half before it somehow cracked from just being in my pocket.  I did nothing that I haven't done a million times before.Pros:  Good Instructions, useful tools.Cons:  Glass is not very sturdy, broke after 1 1/2 weeks There is no doubt this is an amazing bang for your buck!!Bought this for a best ball golf tournament to have on the cart, and it was awesome. Bluetooth works great on both of my devices (Samsung Galaxy s4 and iPod touch 5th generation). The range is great and the music was super clear.The volume is also much higher then i thought it would be! It gets pretty loud for such a little speaker, and it will be perfect for when I move back to my college apartment for sitting outside or for bonfires. The battery lasted the whole golf tournament which was around 6 hours, which is great!This is an awesome speaker for only 40 dollars and worth to have around!! I got 3 different the cases for my HTC ONE, this one is my favorite!!! It fits just right on my macbook laptop. The color looks a little lighter but overall It is a good product. looks good, protects good I wanted a case that didn't add to much bulk to my already huge Galaxy Note 3. This case provides great protection while still keeping a slim profile. I love the rubberized feel to the case. The edges are slightly raised around the screen which allows me to place the phone face down while still protecting the screen from scratches.Spigen makes a great product and I would buy another one of these cases in a heart beat! The Neo Hybrid is definitely the case to own for all Galaxy Note 3 users!PROS:Rubberized case helps you grip the phone (no more drops!)Great protection while still keeping a slim profileSpigen quality craftsmanshipSmart buttons on the sidePerfectly placed holes for charger - S-PEN - etc.CONS:None that I can think of! - Get this case! Junk. Worked once and that was it, won't charge from the USB port or the built in cable. All my other Anker products have been top notch. Low price of the unit doesn't make it worth my time or shipping cost to return. Its low Quality soft material. My Galaxy 4 no funtion whit this cover. It's dirty but nice daughter likes absolutely hands down a fantastic case for the price! Ive had it for 2 months now and have not had one issue. I've accidentially dropped the phone in the case several times from approx 3-4 ft on to concreate and haven't had any scratches, cracks or breaks on the phone... love it! like! seems like it will protected especially on corner drops. the color is pretty  cool. fit good i use it on an iphon5.  Pins did not line up with iphone therefore while trying to place on the phone it shattered, after reading more reviews other people had the same issue and problem was solved for them by cutting off the pins, I solved the problem by purchasing a brushed aluminum back and don't have to worry about the glass anymore!! Worked good, but after a few months of ownership the plastic around the thumb screw split. Very nice looking case for my iPod Touch 5. The OXA juice box is simply amazing. It's great to travel with, or just keep charged in case of power outages, something we have fairly frequently here in NOLA. The two ports come in very handy to charge a couple of phones, phone and tablet, and the battery indicator is a great feature. I know if I need to charge it before tossing it in the travel bag.While the flashlight might seem odd on a charger, it's really a good feature, if the power goes out I can charge up my phone and see what I'm doing not to fall over furniture or the dog. It makes it useful for camping also.The light compact design makes it easy to take with and put in our backpack. This is a very nice charger and flashlight.sample provided, opinion my own I've used this longer term (for several months) and find it very helpful for boosting my Android Smartphone or a 7 Android Tablet.  It does however charge the devices slower than a real wall port.I measured .718A, about 72% of a wall port speed on a single device.  When charging two devices at the same time each device got around .517A, about 52% of wall port speed.The design is nice, rounded black pastic and metal.  The little built in led flashlight is also a cool feature.Overall I'm happy with it, but I don't mind the slightly reduced charging speed, wouldn't think it would be up to the task of charging larger 10 tablets, and charging more than one device at a time is just very slow. comes in handy Would not work had to return product.  Not OEM Have not drop the phone on this case so cannot help on that. On the other hand, the clearness of the case help appreciate the iPhone design. The case seems to provide good protection but it has not been tested. This is good - just took longer to charge than I thought it would The fake carbon fiber backing is starting to separate. The battery hasn't even made a year before it will no longer hold a charge for 8 hours. Nice design and uncluttered interface, decent price.-1 Stars due to the venerable American brand, Motorola now being owned by the Chinese. Thank you Google and the US Government. I prefer the flexible poly-type cases and this one is nice. It's clear so it shows off your customized Moto X well, but also has textured sides to minimize and drops.  I have yet to drop this phone and think that the texture has helped.  The back has this partly frosted texture that I like. this works perfectly.  so glad i got this bought 2 of these one works really well the other not too good .. I've been trying out the Brightech Active2 Bluetooth Headset / Headphones I received recently, and it's a different experience having headphones with no cords. Overall, they worked well, but I'm not sure I'm completely ready to go cordless in all situations.The Active2 paired up easily with my iPhone when I went through the discovery phase. This is a case when it does pay to read the directions, as there's a single button that does a number of different functions. Once I learned that you really *do* have to hold the multi-function button down for 10 seconds, it paired up almost immediately and showed &#34;Active2 Headphones&#34; in my bluetooth device list. The volume up/down buttons also double as the next/previous control buttons for your playlist, the difference being how long you hold the button down. Again, it pays to read the directions first.In terms of actual usage, I had mixed results. I enjoyed having a set of headphones where I didn't have to worry about snagging the cord and yanking them out of my ears. On the flip side, the additional mass on the earbud made them somewhat more susceptible to slipping out of my ear when I was walking/running (sweat, motion, etc.) Also, I still have to get into the habit of making sure I recharge the headphones every couple of days (which is obviously not an issue with regular cord headphones).These *do* work well, and have good sound quality. For me, it really comes down to a matter of how you're planning on using them. For normal movement, they work well. For vigorous exercise, they're not as good.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free Great price came fast love color. The only thing is you have to push hard on the screen to use your phone but it's great to keep your phone safe good deal Saw first hand when my daughter drop the phone like from five feet high and the phone was in tack. The phone drop on a corner edge and nothing happen to it. Furthermore, the clearness of the case help to admire the phone for its design. Only lasted me a few months before it stopped working.  Wouldn't charge battery all the way.  This was my second IPhone 5 battery charger.  Go with the IBattz waterproof one even if you don't need the waterproof as that's an extra feature! A little more but well worth it! My fiance works with this cellpfhone as she expected Caution - my &#34;3-pack&#34; contained only two. I also ordered the Archshield 3-pack to see which was better. Not only did it contain 3 as promised, it is a much better product for a lower price. Buy that instead. Fits the Note 3 perfectly. Nice quality leather. Separate case holds phone and attaches to wallet. Nice protection. The only complaint that removes one star: The magnetic tab obstructs view when in landscape mode and hard to text two-handed when in wallet because of flap. A nice product and good price. I will continue to use until I find another that doesn't have this small issue. Would like S-view window but not completely necessary. Great box just what I was hopin to expect thanks. Please come up with more colors and even better some cool designs I've had my Note 3 Tech Armor glass protector for a couple months now and it was my first ever glass shield. I love it. Will never, ever, ever go back to plastic covers again.The oleophobic coating is a little odd. I get smudgy stuff even with clean hands.I think stock coating was better.BUT, this glass screen, when cleaned, still looks brand new. Not a single scratch.A plastic film would be coming off at the corners by now. Not the glass one. Haven't had a lick of trouble. This is the best Iphone charging case and you get the bonus of it having the water proof option.  A little difficult to hear and be heard on the other end with the water proof case on it but that's a given due to it needing to be waterproof.  Then you can switch to the basic charging case and keeps my Iphone battery going all day.  I will be down to 10-20% and it will charge it back to 100%. I have tried 2 other charging cases and this is the Best!  Reason for 4 stars vs 5 was I had issue with case but Ibattz covered it under warranty and was very happy with that! I upgraded from the original Samsung Galaxy Note to the Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N900) 3 weeks ago.  The first thing that I noticed was the significant improvement in battery life. With moderate use, I can easily use the phone all day before needing to charge it.  The UI is very responsive (my phone arrive with KitKat already installed).  I bought the unlocked version, and have had no problems using it on the T-Mobile network, and have enjoyed 4G speeds everywhere around my house and my work.  The reception has been very good and has not dropped any calls or caused other problems.  The camera and IR blaster work well.  I planning to install an external SD card, but could not find the slot.  This phone does have an external SD card slot -- it is stacked on top of the SIM card slot, so it is easy to miss.  Overall, I have been very happy with the phone and would buy it again. My favorite case. Slim, looks good and offers great protection, combined with screen protector, I don't have to worry about damaging my phone anymore. I even had someone ask me if it was a case or that is how the phone looks from factory. I'm happy. Love it I have been using this case for about 3 weeks with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (SM-N900).  It looks great, fits perfectly, and allows easy access to all of the buttons and ports.  The case has cutouts for all of the buttons (as opposed to featuring rubber protrusions in the case that let you feel where the buttons are).  I happen to like this button strategy because it requires less force to press a button.  However, this means that all of the buttons are in a recess.  While this doesn't bother me, I would imagine that it would be difficult to press the buttons while wearing gloves.  The case is relatively slim and has posed no problems for me getting it into and out of my pocket.  It offers good protection from falls, with a good lip around the screen, so that I don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched if I place it face down onto a table.  The one suggestion that I have is to make the hole around the IR blaster larger, because it may reduce the width of the beam that is being sent out -- however I have not had problems using the IT blaster.  The case is easy to remove when I need to.  Overall. this case works really well for me, and I definitely would buy it again. Good case except I wish I got the black Case.  I upgraded from the Note 2 and they only sold the Otterbox in Grey at the time and it gets dirty very easy especially if you use it at work.  Great product but would recommend black case! So far, so good.  It does everything as described, with no issues yet.Also, there is no way to lock your phone onto the clamp, which concerns me it could eventually fall, however, it is Very secure.  I shook the phone violently while in the clamp over my bed to make sure it didn't fall out before riding.Con: You cannot rotate the device in every direction, but still good product. I wanted a case that let my cute iPhone 5c in PINK shine! This case does the job. It doesn&#8217;t match the pink phone perfectly, but it&#8217;s good enough. I&#8217;d be all-over buying one that did match in color. That said, this clips on with just enough effort that you know it&#8217;s not too cheap. It doesn&#8217;t protect the screen, other than it DOES add a higher profile above the screen. I highly recommend this! I want my money back didn't charge my iPad Air This is exactly what I needed. It came way before it was suppose to. Thank you for the awesome speedily service. It fits perfectly on my galaxy s5. Perfect fit... great protection, I also have tempered glass so looks great.Wireless charging works I love it. You can see the full screen unlike others I have purchased & I love that you include the matching stylus. When it opens from the side it does not get in the way of the charging cable which is a big deal. The handle  & stand that let's it stand on its own are also great features! Ugly This Lightning charger is actually a little better built than Apple's own chargers AND it's a lot less expensive. Fantastic, five stars. Needed to convert a nano sim to micro sim for the OnePlus One.  Works great.  Make sure to clear any glue from the adapter before putting into the phone. If you are looking something made with materials this is your choice This case fits my iPhone 5c great! Good guy highly recommended Works brilliantly and it's fantastic to be able to charge more than one item at a time. Exactly what I needed in a travel charger for my phone and iPad! Very happy with this charger. Mediocre product with poor fit and average sound. I recently purchased this case for my iPhone5. The case came packaged nicely and was easy to open up. After reading the instructions on how to fit the case, I installed it in just a minute. This case fits the phone well and feels good in the hand. Probably the thing I like most about it is the fact that you can still slide the phone in and out of your pocket. Some other cases of this style are difficult to take out of a pants pocket due to the sticky rubber feel. This case comes with some additional back plates of different colors, although I pretty much just like the black one. The volume and on/off buttons function just fine with little effort pushing the buttons. Protection wise, I would say that this case should prevent the phone from getting scratched and getting damage from minor drops. As to whether this case would prevent damage from major drops I can't say, but obviously some protection would be afforded.So far, i rate it 5 stars. Just what I needed for the new galaxy 5.  Easier to put into the phone than the smaller one micro connector. So far been working fine. Fixed a buddies 5S with it. Nothing yet excellent and still holding up better than the ones sent from HTC Unless you are very good on putting protector on phone, try to avoid this.  Especially the back body skin, very difficult to align it and you can clearly see marks on the front screen protector when the screen is not on.The screen protector have a soft gel feeling, which I don't likeAnd it cannot be return, so I just have to throw it away and look for other option daughter loves it Good decent product. like the way it looks and feels had to buy another one cause the belt clip broke when it hit against a chair, but for this amount of money i'm not mad. like I said I like the way it looks and feels in my hand.gonna buy another one if this one breaks too, cause I just like the way it looks and feels love the light being so bright and will charge at least 2 of our cells if we are out in almost out and almost dead .. bought 2 of them.. This protective case fits the Nokia 1520.  It adds a lot of bulk and weight.  No case can provide complete protection but this one adds  SOME protection. I like the little kick stand on the back. When the 1520 is charging the time is displayed. A night stand clock and alarm!HINT:  If you will heat the case in some hot tap water for a while and dry it quickly it will go on the 1520 a little easier!  Still hard to get on but that last corner will snap on. Worked perfectly. Use in conjunction with YouTube video. Some items must be transferred from the old screen, including the speaker grille and little plastic surrounds for the front-facing camera and such. Make sure you know what you are doing.I used this part to repair a phone for a friend and will update this review if the screen dies unexpectedly or any other issues crop up. Got enough juice to power up several phones, tablets, and some misc usb devices. Haven't had any issues with any devices as of yet. Highly recommended I got this for my desk at work since I have multiple devices to charge. I also have other people who will need to charge devices, which may use a cable I don't have. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have far too many of the adapters to plug the cable into but, this is so much more convenient. First of all, it takes up just one plug on a surge protector; something I can't say about all plugs. Second, I don't have, or rather have not had, any issues with devices charging slowly or giving a warning that I'm using the wrong cable or adapter. This did exactly what I wanted and I will be purchasing another one to use when I travel as it will make things much easier for me there as well. Until now has worked very fine, the power adjust automatically in any USB port. Well what can I say it turned up on time its looked like rain all day but it works i put it in the window and it started to charge my power bank if it works with my power bank it will work with any it works on the Nokia Lumina windows 8 phone it runs my usb fan i don't know how Long its takes to charge em all full but on a clouded day it runs a usb fan directly most realistic affordable solar solution to me thanks its 20:47 in the evening its still charging Very disappointed that this charger stopped working after ONE WEEK OF USE! Total waste of money! I will start by saying that I haven't taken the Mocreo travel charger out of the country yet. I've only tested the Mocreo travel charger in the USA using 2 prong or 3 prongs plugs from the USA and USB connected devices. The travel charger is well designed though and everything I've plugged into it has worked flawlessly or charged properly.OUTLETS:The Mocreo travel charger features a 2 prong plug for USA outlets. You can angle the 2 prongs into a V position for Australia and New Zealand outlets. It also features a plug for U.K. outlets and a plug for Europe outlets. An easy to see blue LED lights comes on if the travel charger is properly connected and receiving power. You can plug polarized and non-polarized 2 prong plugs from the USA into the travel charger. Obviously the polarized plugs only fit one way into the travel charger while non-polarized 2 prong plugs can be plugged in either way. I've also connected 3 prong plugs without any problems.USB PORTS:The feature that I love are the dual USB ports. The last few times I've traveled out of the country the items I've needed to plug into an outlet on a regular basis are smartphones and tablets for charging. Previously to charge those devices, I've needed to take a travel charger along with a USB wall charger. With the Mocreo travel charger, it's the only thing I need. The dual ports feature 2100mA charging. I can connect an iPhone or pair of iPhones to the travel charger and the Mocreo will charge them at 1000mA. Or, I can connect an iPad to the travel charger and it will charge it at 2100mA like the USB power adapter does which comes with the iPad.IPHONE & IPAD CHARGING TIMES TESTED:Just to confirm my iPhone and iPad were charging at the correct rates, I tested the charge rates. While charging, my iPhone did so at a rate of 1% per minute up until 80% when the charging rate slowed which is all completely normal for a 1000mA charger. My iPad charged at a rate of 15% per hour which is a little slower that it does with the USB power adapter that comes with the iPad, 18% per hour, but close enough.PLUGGING IN OTHER ITEMS TO THE MOCREO:I plugged a few items with conventional 2 prong or 3 prong plugs into the Mocreo just to make sure they worked properly in the travel charger. My digital camera doesn't feature USB charging so I plugged the battery charger into the Mocreo and fully charged the battery without any problems. I also plugged a light and alarm clock into the Mocreo and let them each run for a while. No issues there either. Lastly, I thought I'd try something more power hungry so I plugged my vacuum cleaner into the travel charger. It ran perfectly.SUMMARY:The Mocreo is a very nice travel charger. What I love most about it are the dual USB ports and that it can charge my iPad at the proper rate. If looking for a travel charger I highly recommend the Mocreo.Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review. So far, so good.  It does everything as described, with no issues yet.I have yet to test to see if the Samsung OEM battery can keep a full charge with it.I will post an update if it fails later. This is the ideal battery pack for the outdoors person, hikers, campers - heck - anyone who works outside. It has a generous 5200mAh capacity, and fantastic protection from the elements.IP67: Total protection from dust,  protected against the effect of immersion between 15cm and 1m. So if you fall in a pool, get splashed, caught in the rain, etc. - Your phone will be trashed, but this battery WILL survive!The flashlight is &#34;meh&#34; - only a couple of candlepower, fine in a pinch - it would light a small spot at your feet, but won't illuminate a small room.  The laser pointer is really bright, but it's at an angle.  If you hold the battery, and point it, the laser is not in line with the length of the battery - it shoots out at about a 20 degree angle.  A little awkward to aim.  But I'll probably use the laser, so it's no biggie.To start charging, simply attach a device to the USB port (the micro-use port is for recharging the EnergyXtreme) and press the power button.  The three segment green LED will indicate the battery charge status, and the final segment will blink so you know it's working.  The output is 1A, so it will take a while to charge devices that have a &#34;fast&#34; charge capability (these can use over 2 amps!)  This is great for phones, music players or small tablets.You will need to carry the charge cable (USB to whatever you need) - the cable is not built in as with other batteries Brightech makes. This product did not work at all. However if I put my other charger into the USB port of this charger that works so it kinda does the job. That's why I gave it to stars Good cable Works exactly the way it's supposed to. Period. Works perfectly as a replacement for the battery that came with the phone.  It holds a charge and makes the phone feel and act like it did when it was new.  Fits perfectly.Sample provided Does not last as long as the original battery provided by Samsung. Also discharges much more quickly. This product is great! I have a couple other types of these batteries, but this one is, by far, the best.  Being able to see how much power is left on it comes in handy.  In our household, we have 4 cell phones, 2 iPads, and 3 tablets.  So we need extra power sometimes.  Especially if we are on a job site, we own a construction company, and when we are out on our boat.  We go overnight fishing and it is nice to know that all the electronics can be kept charged so we can keep in touch with each other and our kids.  I received this item for free to test it, and I have!!!  I've charged my iPhone with it 2 1/2 times without having to charge the battery in between.  I will most likely be purchasing another one of these and passing the other ones on to my kids! I know you will like this item...so go ahead and get one! It is the perfect size A great case at a great price. Protects my phone without adding bulk. Doesn't slip or slid off my hand or other surfaces. All the cut outs are big enough to allow access. The volume and screen lock buttons aren't stiff and don't make manipulating the buttons difficult. Overall a great product, I'd buy it again and recommend it. I was pretty surprised to see this is made in Korea instead of China. A plus for me in terms of Q/C. It has only been on my phone for about an hour, but I am well satisfied with the purchase.  It will obviously provide sturdy protection. It allows for all side buttons to function. And while I dislike the charging port cover to make a concerted effort to open, this case does not impede that task...it still takes skillful fingernail dexterity to open.  I would have preferred a textured back rather than the smooth panel because it feels slippery initially; however the sides are rubber like and that provides a good grip. Now with the addition of Hero Glass screen protector, I am confident I have done my best to provide protection for the sizable investment in my Samsung S5 cellphone. Better impossible!! Perfect case for my S5 not bulky and adds grip. Excellent fit and feels very durable. Fits the S5 perfectly and covers the whole edge of the phone. I love the built in buttons and the 2 tone color is nice in dark shades. The only drawback bring out the difficulty of infidelity wife loves it, I love these screen protectors never had any problems. They even stand up to a 2 year old. I end up with a lot of abrasive chemicals on my hands and these have held up better than most with regard to hairline scratches. They don't resist scratches to the level of a tempered glass protector but, they're less expensive and the design of the M8 makes the tempered glass ones less than user friendly, to me. very nice quality of leather and style Received the case a few minutes ago. Initial impression is that it's beautiful, minimal size, and seems extremely durable. My one major issue with the case is how extremely slick it is. I could see it easily slipping out of my hand. Other than that this case is everything it claimed and we'll worth the small price! Great case for the value tight fit and great protection I love the kickstand Nice colors and outputs power as advertised for Apple products.  Hard to complain about the product itself in that regard.You can get cheaper solutions:As of this writings you can get theBelkin MIXIT Car Charger with USB Port - 2.1 AMP (Black)andAmazonBasics USB Charging and Sync Cable for Apple iPhone 4, iPod, and iPad 3rd Generation - 3.2 Feet (1.0 Meter)for seven bucks less.You could also get thePNY P-P-DC-UF-K01-GE 12 Volt 2.1 Amp Rapid USB Car Charger - BlackandAmazonBasics USB Charging and Sync Cable for Apple iPhone 4, iPod, and iPad 3rd Generation - 3.2 Feet (1.0 Meter)for fifteen bucks less.Also, if you use Android smartphones or other non-apple products you will likely get a very slow charge (0.498A measured) because Apple and other vendors use different signaling mechanisms to indicate a charger can handle more than the 0.5A the USB standard requires to be there. This is a smallish batters charger designed strictly to charge micro-USB and devices with Apple Lightning ports. It recharges from a standard USB port, so you can plug it into a computer, wall charger, hub, etc.  It also includes an extension cable to allow recharging when you can't (or don't want to) plug the battery right into the USB port.Lifting the cap exposes the USB recharge port and the Lightning wire.  The cap itself is the base of the Lightning charger. If your device has a thick case, you may not be able to charge it without first removing the case. For example, my iPod Nano's arm holster was too thick.The bottom of the battery houses the micro-USB cable - it's about 1&#34; long - just enough to comfortably charge my Droid phone.So why 4 and not 5 stars? I wish the micro-USB cable was longer.  The PocketEnergy2 turned off automatically before my iPod was fully charged - but the battery in the PocketEnergy2 was still nearly full.  I had to turn it on again to complete charging.  Finally, the price. 30 bucks for 2600mAh is a bit steep. You're paying for the compact size and convenience of not having to carry around cables 2600mAh will charge an iPod nano around 10 times, or the average Droid phone twice.So with this compact battery pack, you'll add several days to your listening or talk time. Many tablets have 10,000mAh - or more, so this pack will not do much for those.  It's primarily a phone and music player charger. I got one of these for my tablet and I loved it so when I got my new phone it was a no brainer. I prefer this to some of the other more expensive brands (zagg being one of them). This is the easiest screen protector to install that i have ever installed.  The clarity is great,  and the sensitivity is the same as the bare screen.  I highly recommend this product,  as installing  screen protectors is the least favorite task one performs when you get a new phone and this makes it easy. Screen protectors are amazing. They are super clear, perfectly cut and apply very easily. I actually prefer these over the older iSmooth screen protectors. Definitely will be purchasing these for my girlfriend's phone as well. The instructions included in the package are extremely easy to follow for the screen protector rookies out there, but are definitely good to have regardless. The microfiber cloth included is large and I now carry it in my electronics pouch for screen, glasses cleaning, etc. Keep up the great work! These screen protectors are better than some of the more expensive ones I have bought! So far, so good.  It does everything as described, with no issues yet.  I will post an update if it fails later.I have yet to test to see if the battery is as good as the one that came with the phone. Great Phone so far. I love my S5. Battery is very long lasting and the phone is awesome. This is okay if you want the stand.  I wanted it to replace the back that is now on the phone.  This case makes it bigger than I wanted.  But it is a nice case The Aukey Dual USB Car Charger is one of the best chargers for your car out there. I always carry around my iPhone and iPad and the fact that this car charger has dual USB ports is great! Not only does this charger have a nice build quality, it is lightweight. Using the car charger is super easy because all you have to do is plug it into the outlet of your car and just like that, your devices are ready to be charged! Some other car chargers I have used didn't charge my devices quick but Aukey's car charger charges them very quick so I can get back to what I'm doing. Just as described.This case is perfect They are &#34;just okay.&#34; Not really loud, but not too bad. The fit is perfect!! I definitely like them from that perspective! It is amazing. I have had all Galaxy S models...!!! Arrived cracked! Amazing screen protector the oleophobic coating is amazing and the 2.5d rounded edges are amazing I don't have any issues with my case unlike other glass screen protectors A+ for quality and attention to detail It's a good case I like how they throw in a stylist in with it It has only been on my Samsung cellphone for about an hour along with Spigen case; but it was easy to install seems to resist those messy fingerprints and easy to wipe clean. well, i didn't get for me. the case is for my wife. She likes it, so I'm happy if she is happy. Not reliable.  Ships from Asia (Why not just send it from Pluto?).  Mine doesn't charge properly or keep the charge very well.  Fairly useless. Use for my SGNote 3. Works even better than I expected. Would purchase it again. Charges fast even though it's not using a 3.0 micro USB. extremely lightweight Cord is way too short Is works incredibly well, fits securely and doesn't impede the sensitivity of the touch screen.  We had no problem with installation.  My son is rough on his phone and this I believe has been a great help in protecting it from the damage a 16 year old, spoiled kid can do.Sample provided I got this when I got my phone and I couldn't be happier. I like how it's dual layed for extra protection. It's not bulky like a lot of dual layered cases. The color is also great Great case bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it So far, so good.  It does everything as described, with no issues yet.  I haven't dropped it from a huge height to know if it works for protection. Bought this and tried it out, but didn't like it very much.  The screw at the bottom impeded usage of the radio. Also, the swivel wouldn't tilt down enough and my phone reflected the sky through the moonroof.  Got the Mountek nGroove Snap 2 instead and love it. A great little charger, especially when you are on festivals or camping. It's size of a phone so it is easy to carry. Fast delivery time will definitely use the company again. I love this case. Perfect case fir the perfect phone.  Not too bulky compared to other cases with the sane protection.  I highly recomend it. Unlike the bulkier cases out there this one is quite rugged and quite thin, which is nice. The built in screen protection is also nice but it's hard to get it on dust-free and the responsive touch capability is sometimes affected (if there are too many fingerprints on it, for example - and I've found that it doesn't even need to be extraordinarily dirty; just from normal usage.) and it can be a bit annoying to not be able to unlock your phone until you clean it. This may be an issue if you need to access the phone in a hurry.I like that the case comes with 3 interchangeable cover plates so that you can personalize the look without having to buy a whole new case. Got this for my parents as a just in case emergency contact.What I find is good about this phone is that the numbers to call are HUGE, good for an elderly person. Plus there is a 5Star button that directly connects to a NAED Certified Response agent in times of emergency. Thereafter the agent will confirm the person's location via GPS technology in the phone.Definitely a life saver in times of need. The product dose its job like that its longer that the original. This help me from yanking the plug out the outlet. Moreover, the product feel and look sturdy. It is nice to have a six foot cord for your iPhone or iPad so you can view your apps in bed while it is charging.  Good concept, my wife loves it. I've been using these for a couple of weeks and I've been very pleased with the experience. For something to wear while outside, they're the best option I've used.It's not that they have better sound than anything else I've ever tried, or that they're far out ahead in staying in place, or that they have the best safety features, or that their battery life knocks it out of the park, or that they stay out of the way the best, it's that I feel Plantronics did a great job of taking all of the conflicting priorities it takes to make a really good bluetooth headset for outdoor exercise and deciding how to balance them.These are comfortable enough that I rarely think about them once they're on.The sound quality is quite good. It's not as good as options I've tried that are designed to be noise isolated and to sit inside my ear, but those qualities aren't always the priority. I have another bluetooth headset that I sometimes wear and only put one earpiece in, so that I can keep enough of my hearing for basic safety (such as being able to hear when a car is approaching). I can wear these in both ears, and still hear what's going on around me just fine.The pouch that comes with them is nice, and the fact that it can be turned into an armband is an interesting touch, but it's worth noting that it'll mostly only end up holding midsized to smaller devices. For smart phones, I can jam something with a 5&#34; screen in there if I really want to, but it certainly doesn't fit really well, so I prefer to just treat the pouch as a holding pouch.They've been doing a very good job of holding their charge, and I can use them to walk my dog several times before I worry about plugging them in again.These would probably not be my first choice if I were heading to the gym or hopping on the treadmill in my own home (unless I was wanting to make sure that I'd hear easily if someone was talking to me or something on that particular day). I prefer to block out the world a little more when I'm doing those things.I think it's reasonable to assume that these are much safer for older children and teenagers (those who are big enough to wear these, basically) vs headphones that sit inside the ear, since they're not just blasting sound directly at the ear (there are a lot of warnings out there about not letting kids have the headphones that go into the ear, because they tend to turn the volume too high and damage their hearing).When I'm in a situation where I need to be able to hear what's going on, I feel far better going out wearing these than I do in noise-isolating headphones. I've walked around with music playing and have still been able to hear cars, and the air conditioning units on nearby houses as they're running, and dogs when they see me from their yards, and that kind of thing. I own more headphones than I care to admit.  I currently use a pair of LG Tones that I really like. They are lightweight, sound good and I don't mind the collar.So going into reviewing these that was the baseline.I really like how these stay off my neck.  I never really had a problem with the weight of the LG's but if its hot out or Im exercising, the contact of the collar and my skin is annoying.  These are about half an inch from my head when I wear them.  The skin touching problem is taken care of - but replaced with the bouncing problem.  If I am running I can feel the band in the back of my head moving up and down.  It's also annoying.  So I guess I get to pick which annoyance I want to deal with.Other than that - I really like the sound quality.  They are comfortable to wear, even though the ear buds are a different style (harder plastic) than the LG's (squishy rubber).They paired with my phone very easily.  They look sporty.  The controls are a little annoying to use because of how hard you have to press the button it hurts my ear.  Maybe hurt is too strong - it is momentarily uncomfortable.I have no complaints about them. If I had to choose between these and my LGs I will choose these purely on comfort. I am a runner, gym patron, and longtime Plantronics bluetooth customer: I've had several 903+'s and a Go 2.  The Go 2 doesn't stay in my ears and is on the large side for exercising, but it seemed like the best thing available last year.The Fit is disappointing in three ways: 1)  It's not loud enough, 2) the ear pieces hurt my ears due to their hardness, and 3) the phone functionality is the worst of the Plantronics I've had, and the call quality isn't very good with the other Plantronics headphones I mentioned above.1) Not loud enough -- The is a big problem.  I like to download movies to my Note 3 and watch them in the gym as I work out.  These movies typically play more quietly than other videos.  The Go 2 plays the movies just loud enough for me to hear and enjoy them in my noisy gym.  The Fit plays the very same movies just quietly enough that I can't hear them in the gym.  Music and other videos that play louder sound excellent.I have a speakerboost application that doesn't seem to make any difference to the Fit volume, but they have a feature that Plantronics should use.  Namely, they only boost to 60% unless you go into settings and allow them to boost more, which requires acknowledging that you are making this change.  If Plantronics is so worried about lawsuits if they make the headphones loud enough to hear in noisy places, they should use this feature to allow people to choose a higher volume.2)  The Fit doesn't fit --  The Fit earphones do stay in place no matter what I do.  I think it may also be possible to find positions for each ear that don't hurt, but so far, I have either failed to achieve that or I may have succeeded once.  They take me a lot of fiddling with them to try to find a position that won't hurt.Why it would have been so hard to make the earpieces softer is anyone's guess.3)  Call quality is bad -- I've made five calls with the Fit.  Three were so bad on both ends, it was almost pointless.  Two were good on both ends.  The three that were bad were with the same person, someone with whom I had spoken on the Go 2 as well.  On the Go 2, the other party sounded fine but complained about background noise.  With the Fit, both sides break up terribly and the person on other side hated the noise far worse than with the Go 2.It's nice to have earphones that stay in place--I bought a pair of wired earphones 7 years ago for under $5.00 that had an over-the-ear component that kept them in place, but they weren't waterproof.  It's nice that in 2014 Plantronics had the breakthrough of waterproof earphones that stay in place.  Now if I could only hear them without ear pain and make calls, they'd be perfect.  Perhaps Plantronics will resolve one of these issues next year and soak me for another $150, then resolve another one in the following year for, say, $180, and maybe they can do the last one in three years for, say, $210.UPDATE:  I exchanged my pair in hopes that my complaints were particular to the unit I received.  The connecting chord in back on the new one is slightly longer, within a margin of manufacturing error.  With the new one, I can get a more or less comfortable fit.  Unfortunately, the volume level and call quality are precisely the same. Fit the phone perfectly, Product was just as described. Would buy from again. Love it, makes my Iphone 4s shatterproof, very useful when kids are playing with phone. Also it fits perfectly. love it and great value! Wow!  This is fantastic. I was a little skeptical when I ordered this because I have had several different screen protectors for my iPhone 4s and although they all protect my screen from scratches, I ALWAYS have at least a few bubbles and they drive me crazy. I know bubbles are better than scratches but I wanted clear and clean as well as protected and now I have it. This is tempered glass, it LOOKS and FEELS exactly like the real phone screen. It was the easiest screen protector to apply, I'm still amazed by it. I cleaned my screen with the microfiber cloth it came with and then used the dust sticker it came with to be sure it was really clean. I then applied the white raised button sticker as my iPhone is white(it comes with 2 a black one and a white one ,nice surprise)I pulled back the sticker half way and lined up the speaker hole at the top and slowly pulled the sticker down until it was off and right before my eyes instantly I could see the sealing occur from top to bottom. NOT one single bubble. Amazing!!!  I've used it all day today and my screen is so clean, sharp, clear and free from finger prints. The best part is this screen protector is shatterproof so the protection is at a much greater level than the plastic ones. Great protect. I absolutely recommend this to anyone with an iPhone 4, 4s or 4g needing a screen protector. This versatile charging station has smart circuitry for advanced power management and fast charging as well as OTG facilitation.There are two smart USB ports to deliver up to 2.4 A for fastest charging of almost any small electronic device plus two dedicated USB ports for Apple and Android devices with 1.5 A each for total maximum output of 7.8 A when all four ports are in use.There are also paired OTG USB ports and an OTG-only cable, allowing peripherals to be used with Android 4.2 and higher devices.  The OTG cable cannot be used for charging.A detachable power cable is included and there is an LED indicator for power status.  The case is compact and has four large grippy feet underneath.  There is a legible user manual and everything is packaged in a recyclable frustration-free box.Sunvalleytek provided a charging station for evaluation and review. I have not used it very often yet because I bought it as a back up. It looks and feels original for the few times I used it seems to be a good product. Very bumpy case, but I think it makes it easier to pick up. The bumps kind of make a little space between the table and the phone so that my nails can slip in between and pick the phone up easier. It's like a little piece of heaven. I feel so fancy using this phone, like it's some really expensive brand. It also doesn't scrape very easily. I have dropped it many times and it still doesn't have a scratch. I got this case for a family member who loves anything that sparkles and shines. It was the perfect addition to her iPhone. She can't put it down. She loves the look and feel of the case. Well worth the money spent on it. So so smooth! I've got to be careful of not dropping it, but the look of it looks great! I like how the pattern of scales on the back are all different shapes and sizes, so it makes the case look even more like the skin of an animal. No animal's skin is perfect and exactly the same shape. Each case has a different look on the scales and it is so cool! If you know how tough crocodiles are, you already know how tough this skin is going to be. Once you put it on your phone, you don't have to worry about it being protected anymore. I got this for a backup case, but it ended up turning into a case that I use all the time. A must-have for any iPhone owner. I love this galaxy-looking phone case! I painted my nails the same color so now it looks pretty awesome when I use it:P Even though it's not all that cheap for a phone case, i'm glad I got it, it looks like it's going to last me at least 10 years or so! Very well constructed and it makes me feel like my phone is more protected since I dropped it multiple times already and nothing has happened. I am not obsessed with this case. I read some of the reviews before buying it and I wasn't so sure if I should spend money on another case, but I feel so much better now that I did. This case is so unique. I am always rubbing the bumps on the back and it just makes my phone feel so much slicker, like it's some sort of reptillic phone! If you are looking for something unique, you have to check out this case. It looks and feels like snake-skin, which is what makes it so unique. This case is one that very few people are going to have, so grab yours today. It is well worth the money spent. Feels fantastic. I feel like such a nerd buying all these phone cases just because they feel good, but they are great. I like switching cases every now and then just for something new. This case not only has a cool design but a cool color as well, and that's why I ended up buying it. I am happy with my purchase This one actually works unlike some others I bought I get error msg saying this is unauthorized will not charge. This feels durable and not some flimsy garbage wire. The best part of this wire is, it is long enough for it to be plugged in and I can actually still use my phone while its charging since the wire is long enough. Takes forever to charge.  Used a regular cord with same charger and works just fine.  The phone looses power with it plugged into the charger using this cord. LOVE LOVE LOVE this case... the Purple is SO color rich!! Considering the Red and Blue also :) Very good sound, good build quality, but I got mine for $44, I wouldn't pay $129 for sure .Great case! Protection is fantastic, it looks sharp, (the price is great), and I love the changeable color panel on the back. You can even cut out the shape of the panel they give you onto colored paper and make your own! I made a bright blue one for mine and now I love the case even more. I wasn't really a fan of the orange color in the picture and thank goodness it isn't permanent. Everyone with a Note 2 should own this case, hands down. Really great product. Works very well. Works just as expected, I put this screen almost three months ago and is still pretty much new This is a very pretty case and was well worth the price.  It is a little thinner than my Incepio case, but it's a lot prettier!  It didn't say in the description, but it comes with a screen protector and cleaning cloth- which was a very nice surprise! I really like it. Dropped my phone on carpet and cracked this replacement back I have 3 of these,  a little loose but I cant complain, still works well Works just fine, exactly as expected is excellent for there category Having an original spare battery that gets fully charged is a plus. waooooooooo perfect My battery dies very fast so this was such an amazing solution!! When it is in use for a while it can get very hot but that's my only complaint!! I recomend this to anyone!!! Just a screen cover, Works just as expected, I sold the phone but I will buy this item again Took me all three films to get it stick perfectly. The first film, there were too many steps and confused me, making me bend it. Second film, I kept readjusting it that it lost the stickiness. The third film was the charm. Not great quality after a few months of use gets really dirty and it can&#8217;t be wiped or washed love i t This is actually the second one I've bought. This is 100% OEM original from Samsung and is the usual high quality product. Battery is identical to the one shipped in the phone and the charger is super compact and easy to throw in a backpack or purse. It comes with a cable and AC wall charger as well. No complaints. Price is comparable to what you'd expect from OEM accessories. The hard cover fits very snugly over the silicone, and the case doesn't make the phone very bulky at all. The buttons also still work really well. I'd love to see a hard cover that is nonslip, but otherwise, this case is great. perfect for what i need and cheap thanks Works, looks better than my previous case. Volume rockers much easier to push. Has yet to discolor like my previous &#34;clear&#34; case. Takes a beating and gives basic protection to the phone. Brought for friend. she looks it Fits like a glove. I like the texture of it, the design. I only had it a week and the sticky part just fell out and stopped sticking bought an OtterBox case for my previous Galaxy device and loved it, so when I upgraded to the S4, buying a case was an easy choice. The Defender Series provides very, very solid protection for your phone with as little added bulk as possible. Looks like the pic.. magnet is a little weak tho Awesome case.  Fits snugly and is a soft rubber case.  I have had no problems with it.  The mint is a very pretty color too. This a nice little case.  I has three card slots and a larger slot for holding money or whatever.  I like the magnetic close. good tight hold but the cushion on the side to hold the phone really suck ... after 3 days of use one side can off Initially I bought this item with the hopes of placing it on my dashboard. I was followed the directions and was able to mount it with the sticky attachment. However, after a week the mount began to pull the sticky part off of my dash. In the end it came off and I had to instead attack it to the windshield. At least it did not leave any sticky residue on the dash.Some thoughts: the ball joint that allows you to swivel the phone around does not have enough tension. This results in the phone not staying in place.Bottom line: After a few months of dealing with several annoying features with this item I decided to buy a Kenu Airframe vent mount from Amazon. I am 100% happy with my Kenu and wish I had spent the 10 bucks extra at the start. Now I am stuck with the FunTM mount that I will never use. Visually cute but after time the edges started to look dingy and peel back Added a LUVVIT tempered glass protector and I have one very well protected phone. Superbly happy with the drops, flips, and would-be scratches, yet my phone still looks good. Brought it for a friend and she like it. I love it.  Just what I needed. I got a package of these cases but wanted the purple silicone so I bought this extra...LOVE these cases. The plastic outer case will eventually snap in places bc of the cut outs so I'd recommend getting a package of them ; ) Not very fond of these covers. It was difficult to put on the phone, even more of a pain to take off. It is too flimsy because of the zebra line. The actual outer covers are thin, causing the cover to bear or crack. Used only one set. Not intending to use the others. Look cute, but not very efficient. Love these covers...and I loved that I got so many for cheap ; )One black plastic outer case lasted about 5 months before it started snapping in places...but Luckily I got two with this package ; ) Still using them! I loved my Samsung Galaxy Proclaim, but when I got my new S4, it blew my mind. The screen is so amazing that it honestly hurt my eyes a little for the first hour or so (in the same way that a new glasses prescription hurts - your brain is getting so much more visual information than it's used to, so it needs a minute to adjust). As a teacher, one of my favorite features is S-Beam. S-Beam allows you to send a file to another Samsung phone, just by tapping the two phones back-to-back. When I need to give each of my students a copy of a handout, I no longer need to print one for each student. I print copies for those without Samsungs, but for those students who have Samsungs, I just walk around the room and &#34;bump&#34; the file to each of them.In case anyone reading this has read that sometimes when you order a phone online, what arrives is a knockoff, I will say that when I got my phone, I checked all of the tell tale signs for knockoff S4's and the phone I received is definitely authentic. The Nokia Lumia 520 is the best phone in this price range. It comes with separate wall charger, usb cable and earphones. Unlike the most of android phones in that price range this phone has much better options. First i'll start with the battery time it lasts about 12-13 hours talk time or 300 hrs stand-by. Then the camera has nice touch-to-focus option but some of the photos have noise, the video quality is very nice and has also auto-focus option. The display is crystal-clear and is big enough (4.0 Inches). Also one more good option are HERE MAPS that come with free downloadable maps and navigation voice for the entire planet. Also one more good thing about his phone are the upcoming windows 8.1 and lumia cyan update which will bring additional options like Cortana (similar to ask Siri) and the swipe keyboard.The only con of this phone is the RAM Memory (512 MB) which isn't enough for some apps. But anyway if you are looking for good phone that has many options and is cheap this is that phone.If you have some questions about it please comment i will try to answer ASAP :) Perfect quality looks the same I kinda already knew but tried it anyways and it's not something I will put my GN3 into, spring loaded and the pads and slippery and the phone does not stay on the pads for me and damn near scratched my screen so into the trash it went. I love this stylus. I don't feel like I am hanging onto the nub of a well used pencil. Thus far the mesh glides well. No skidding or dragging. I don't understand why the colored stylus were so much more expensive, I settled and got the silver pack. My husband has already asked for one of them, it has a slightly larger (feeling) barrel so it fits his hands better than the thin ones. This will be much harder to lose down in the chair cushion.I would have given a 5 star review but for one thing. The loooooong elastic tether is awesome. No worry about losing my awesome stylus when I'm away from home. However, the metal eye connector that connects the elastic to the split ring has exceedingly sharp edges tha would be sure to scratch glass if they were drug across the glass... Like if the elastic is over the glass, the connector attached to the jack adapter IS going to rub against the glass. This is a bad thing. I reworked mine with some scavenged parts I had around here. I only had enough parts for one.. My husband, who is not worried about aesthetics as much as he cares about functionality just put some electrical tape on it. And why two tethers with three stylus? That is kind of an uneven distribution if you were sharing with three people.There are a number of people who don't use the tether at all... I didn't until I got this stylus. If the tether isn't an issue for you, then this is a 5 star product for sure. It shipped quickly and arrived before the dates given. I will be looking to the. Friendly Swede for future iPad accessory needs. Great caser that fits well and delivered as ordered. Looks very good at a great price. as kmashi offers a true salidad 1amp this model of flashlight included, everything really well with them, the burden is really ultra fast. Total trash. There was ZERO adhesive on the back of the glass. All it did was to slide on the screen of the iPhone 5; could not figure it out. Then I took the glass and looked and touched the adhesive side of the glass. Nothing there; no sticky feel.And yes, I was touching the right side of the glass. I purchased this case for my 12 y.o. daughter. It fell apart after 2 weeks of use. It looks nice from afar. Up close, it looks as cheap as it actually was. Lol. It did, however, protect & secure phone during the short time that it stayed together. Long enough.Good price.Locks well at the connection with my phone.Lasted better then many other I have tried already. I was looking for a charging data cable that was long enough so I can use my phone and charge at the same time without having to be so close to an outlet. These work wonders!! Bought it for my mother for her iPhone that I also bought her for her christmas present. She loves it and the iPhone. If you got a 5c and you want to take advantage of the color you also chose for it, this is a great choice for a case. I love this case it was so cheap but it's a really good quality I recommend this case to everyone this case is amazing I love it so much Its perfect. It does what it is suposed to do. This is the second phone holder I purchased. I initially bought the &#34;Do Good Have FunTM Car Phone Mount for Windshield&#34; on Amazon for $14. I wish I would have spent the money on this holder from the start.The Airframe is very sturdy and has no issue clipping on to my 2011 Prius vent. The FunTM mount I had purchased suctioned to my windshield which I thought would be the best location, but I was wrong. Once I got the Airframe I realized how much of my view the windshield mounted holders block. This thing is also much more sturdy than the FunTM. This is in part due to the fact that the FunTM mount swivels and the Airframe is stationary, but the Airframe is also a much more solidly built product.One more thing - I like having my phone attached to the vents as the AC keeps the phone cool. I had some heat concerns with my old holder as the dashboard and area under the windshield got really hot in the summer.Bottom line: I love this thing and have ordered another for my wife. Invest the extra $10 in the Airframe from the start and you will be happy. It feels like it will last a long time and securely holds my phone for me to use while I drive. Lightweight junk, phone also does not seat well.  If this were five dollars, I'd say i got what I paid for... but it wasn't. It's a little hard to apply if you are not used to do a wet application but after it dries out it looks fantastic.it has the same feel as the ZAGG product and also comes with lifetime warranty! These sync cables worked perfectly with my iPad 2. I appreciate the length because I often use them with a plug when my iPad is running low.They stayed tightly connected in my iPad and charged it well.The bright and cheery colors were helpful when I had to use them in the hospital, it made them easy to spot and remember to bring home. Awesome charging cradle. Just drop my phone one it and go. Keeps my phone at 100% battery. My wife loves this case. Not impressed by this product ,first it was not loud enough to hear audiobooks over the water and fan, second the little rubber cover for the power socket came off after like two charges, eliminating its waterproofing. I ended up passing it on to a friend. This is a great screen protector.  Very easy to put on. Bought this so I could replace my GF's cracked screen. I have a little skill when it comes to this kinda stuff but none was needed. The instructions/youtube video were very easy to follow. The only difficulty was in removing her old cracked screen Can only be plugged in one way for it to work! I bought other protective films from the same company, but this one is ughhh!! horrible!! if you are looking for a anti-glare film , please look somewhere else.this film just make things worse when it comes to reflection on the sun, it glares the whole screen. i would choose the clear HD film next time much better! Update: Anker was kind enough to contact me and offer to replace my product. They sent me free shipping to return the old one and will ship me another one. Great!Original Review:This is a great design using quality, durable material to hold the panels. I love how it folds up and has build-in metal-ringed holes for hanging it! It's the perfect size for putting on your dashboard in your car to charge devices while driving.It worked great for the first few months. Now it just doesn't seem to work all the time. It still works, but it's not reliable with my cell phone. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't seem to be putting out electricity at all. When it does work, sometimes the charge is so small (in direct sunlight) that the phone has to be OFF to recognize that it is getting electricity. I have checked the cords and made sure that it is plugged snugly into the USB 1 output slot on the solar charger.I'm not sure if I got a defective one, or maybe if it's my phone but this hasn't worked quite as well as I had hoped. I've used this product a few times so far, and been pleased with it.  It seems sturdy and has charged both my iPad Mini and iPhone 5s almost as fast as if they were plugged in to the wall.  I find it works fine when laid flat in sunshine, charging with no problem.  I tried leaning it up at a bit of an angle against a picture window...there it was a bit touchier.  It did fine on the iPhone, but wanted the sun to be full on it (no overcast clouds) to maintain a steady charge for the iPad.  I'd hear a faint beep and find a message on the screen warning me that not all connections could charge an iPad...but when the sun came back out full, it did fine.  Essentially it seems that for the iPad, overcast days and/or the angle of the charger makes a difference...which I'd expect, since it requires more power.  The next day, outside with the charger laid flat, it did a super job.I'm very pleased with Anker products...I own about 5 items or more, and every one has worked as expected or better.  I don't think you'll go wrong with this, and I like the idea that I can charge my Anker backup battery chargers with the solar charger during the daytime and have enough power to go through the night and then some.  (Or have power if the next day is cloudy.)  Thanks, Anker! Great bundle for my S5! Nice case. But what else does Spigen produce? Excellent protection.I had a thicker glass screen protector (from Spigen, who else) and it sits a little high for the screen side of the case. Use a thinner screen protector.The thicker screen protector does't impact the protection. The Inateck BP2001 is a compact portable speaker that packs quite the punch. In the box it comes with a charging cord, user manual and an auxiliary 3.5mm cord. Without ever plugging the device in to charge before use I was able to get about two and a half hours of playtime at fairly high volumes. In this review I did a side-by-side comparison with theTYLT Tunzwhich cost more than double the price. As far as price range is concerned, this speaker is a few steps above.  Here are some pros and cons I noticed for of the device.Pros[+] Comes precharged[+] Clear crisp sound even at top volume[+] No distortion[+] Price is great for the quality[+] Sturdy design and kickstandCons[-] Not a lot in the lower register[-] Will not pair with some android devices[-] Does not have an aux outWhen putting the speaker head to head with the TYLT Tunz I was not expecting the device to stand as tall as it did. With both at top volume the Tunz began distorting bass and mid range where the BP2001 continued to remain true. With both beginning at a full charge the BP2001 only died fifteen minute before the Tunz. Overall if you are looking for an economically designed and priced Bluetooth speaker, I would put the BP2001 at the top of your list. I was provided the speaker for review by the manufacturer. I stand by my review - this is a quality product. Unfortunately someone swiped it off my desk so I suggest putting it away if you work in an office with heavy foot traffic. really like for the price,  I bought for my 9in HD Nook, a little different than a Barnes and Nobles nook protector.  thicker and 30 dollars at store. I have almost two weeks using this battery and I can say it's excellent. It gives me about 2 full charges on my phone. It charges my phone very fast (I have a short and thick cable for this, maybe it matters). Very convenient and it's no heavy. Recommended yes excellent product! We love this brand films, they're the best, protect, clear and once you apply them correctly, they're forever. Recommended Why dont you own this phone? Can hardly tell its even there. My friend also has a Moto X and doesnt use a screen protector and was ridiculing me for getting one to put it on but I like to keep my devices as pristine as possible. I highly recommend this product. I already have a scratch on the protector (though this doesnt necessarily mean it would have been a scratch on the screen as the glass is much more resistant than the protector is) - I am still happy I have it and would highly recommend this if you own a Moto X and are considering a screen protector. They send you 3 which is good because I messed up doing the first one. Just run a hot shower with the door closed and go in there to put it on. This will eliminate most of the dust that is capable of getting in between the screen and the protector. I got this for my husband he he loves it.  It is a nice color and very sturdy. Broke in a little while. The e-thinker 2.5D is way better. Works as good as the original. As a matter of fact, I wish I had marked the battery. I can't tell the difference between this one and the original as advertised As far as minimalist TPU cases are concerned, I've tried them all. Having ordered every major brand and variation from Amazon.com or otherwise, this is one of only two cases I've found to actually satisfy my apparently high expectations. (The other being theBody Glove Dimensions Satin TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Black, my personal favorite.)Most importantly, the case actually fits the phone precisely! An extremely rare feat, for some reason. Unlike most TPU cases, the cutouts are all accessible and line up as expected. Even the silver bezel around the front of the phone is completely covered with no adjustment efforts required - the fit is immediate and snug.The design is very simple and even the branding logo is pretty sleek and unobtrusive. I especially like that the power and volume buttons are covered, but still easily pressed. My only gripe is the grip - the matte finish is a little slick, but nothing too concerning.A rather flawless execution of a simple and minimalist design. Color me impressed. Works really well. Does what it says and pretty small. It actually worked better than the $30 one I got for the Nexus 5 from Google. Like other comments it does beep when the phone is place to notify that it is charging. This is my third case and by far has the best build quality.  This product is so well designed it feels like a crowbar is needed to remove from the phone.  It's very rugged and slim in appearance however the back is too &#34;frosted&#34; and should have been clearer to allow the metallic look of the phone to shine. It fits the Note 3 like a wet glove. Plus, they skimped on the length of the armband, so unless you're a petite jogger don't expect this band to give you a good fit, the neoprene will be stretched to attach the velcro. I used mine twice and gave up on it. Purchased for my granddaughter, she loves it. A+ This battery is fantastic. I have 3 iPods and 1 Android tablet that I charge with this device in conjunction with the &#34;Battery Doctor&#34; app. It will not work with my iPad, but that's okay. My ALLPOWERS needs re-charging only once per week, and I do it overnight because it shuts off automatically when 100%. I also take it with me on my workplace and keep it my locker, so when one of my devices goes dead I can recharge. Great product. It came out perfect the first time. Every other times I was struggling with other brands. looks good on the phone Not so clear but it works well for the low cost My daughter was so excited when she got these!  And I was because they weren't as expensive as the other ones! This useful accessory for smartphones and tablets combines a stand with two side-firing 3 W speakers for enjoying video or music from portable devices.  The speakers produce clear and enjoyable sound at reasonable volumes.It connects easily by Bluetooth or the included 3.5 mm audio cable can be used for a wired connection.  It is compatible with almost any portable electronic device with audio and can also be used with stereo systems, desktop computers, etc.The 1,000 mAh internal lithium-ion battery provides portability for use outdoors or for convenience inside and a USB charging cable is included.There is a choice of three colors.  The coffee is almost a titanium color and is quite attractive.LugoLake provided a speaker stand for evaluation and review. love it but it is hard to get on the phone OK, I love having the dual port car charger ... since I often charge BOTH my cell phone and my tablet. This is super because it really does charge both at once.BUT, since the ports aren't clearly marked, especially for those who are wrestling with cords in the car, it is a bit less convenient than other dual chargers I have tested.The one thing I have found that works is to keep one of the cords plugged in (even when the charger is unplugged) so that I can quickly know which port to use.It is fast charging, as advertised if the items are plugged in correctly.I received a free sample to use to test this product in order to produce an unbiased review. Excellent protection for how thin the case is.  Nice 'lip' on front to protect screen, flexible but strong 'back' gives a solid and sturdy feel.  White looks great, until it gets dirty.  But help up great for a year until the dirtiness started bothering me.  Overall, excellent case! Was not happy with this item. At first look it appears nice. Closer look studs are not even and it does not close, as mentioned in other reviews.  In my case the zipper would not even open. I would not suggest purchasing this product. I returned mine. love it but i wish i could get it to flip around to where the screeen is facing out beautiful case and great new color for me.  Classy. good price It is deceptively large.  It will only take up one plug space, but this is not a &#34;small&#34; device like the dual usb charger that comes with the Moto X for example. bad cables Good value. Good build quality. Good sound. SOUL seems to provide a good value for the $. Great screen protector that fits well and delivered as ordered. Looks very good at a great price. The case that I received is a wonderful case and I give that a higher rating. Unfortunately it is not the case that I ordered. It is for a different model of tablet. I look forward to getting the proper case in the near future and would have rated higher if it was the right one and if I knew that the tablet would stay all of the way into the snap in part. Like I said, wrong case so not a proper fit. Great Cover Great! There are two main things that separate this from all the other USB car chargers on Amazon: snug fit of the USB ports and power socket, and the inclusion of a 4-foot microUSB cable. I've had another 2-port car charger, but it seems to pop out of the power socket every few minutes from the vibration of the vehicle. This one fits much more snugly and doesn't budge. The same goes for the USB ports themselves...the ports are quite snug so you the cords shouldn't dislodge with the slightest tug, but don't worry, they are not too tight to use easily. There's a blue ring around the charger that lets you know it's working, and can help you find the USB ports in the dark. The 4-foot microUSB cable feels high quality, and it's something most chargers will make you buy separately. I did a quick search on Amazon, and I couldn't find another car charger that combined the 3.1-total-amp dual-port car charger with 4-foot microUSB cable for this great low price. Great case - easy to put on and take off.  Have dropped my phone once where it flung out of my hand and landed on my concrete basement floor - no scratches or dings resulted.The built in screen protector doesn't affected visual quality....no rainbow affect.  No problems fitting any headsets I own into the headset port.  Typical docking issues with most protective cases.....need an adapter such as the new Dockstubz from Cable Jive. I bought this to my wife's iphone 5S and didn't expect the she would like it. but as soon as I got it on , she and I really loved it. It was a no brainer to put it on but I had a little trouble to change the colored face plate, but after reading the instruction more carefully It was really easy. I had to change the plate first and then fit in to the phone.I does get thicker but I it is less than the othesr on the market and the gold or silver plate makes all the difference specially when a woman is using it and they always love something that you can choose between .i also loved the film that stays on top of the button instead of a hard plastic so it is very comfortable to use without compromising the protection. Really rugged and well made! Pros:  this case fit the iphone5 very well, and seems to provide excellent protection in a very thin case. The interchangeable color plates add a nice touch.Con: the only thing that is missing for me would be an available belt holster. This case is great. It is smaller then my life proof case.  It has a sleek design and different color options for the rear panel.  The size is great not bulky at all.  I dropped the case several times and it held up fine.  The only thing that would have made this 5 out of 5 would be a waterproof case.  The rear camera has no plastic coverings protecting it so pictures are clear.  The front face is protected by a clear plastic case that is pretty durable.  Overall this case is worth the money., but don't talked it swimming !!! looks just like the real thing but not ...  holding up pretty good charging and xfer data It works great. I haven't tried out the NFC function yet.There is a slight bulge, but it doesn't bother me. I'm using it with the Tylt charger and it works great. My 5s was smashed to oblivious (in a liferpoof case too.. weird?). So I figured it was time for something new. I was very hesitant, nervous, and first question I asked ATT was (when can I return it?). It was huge, bold, loud, and shiny, and seemed cool on the surface. I went over my head, being a cloud advocate, everything I would have to do (contacts.. iCloud calendars, pictures, tasks, email accounts..) Before this, it was seamless, get a new iPhone, plug in my icloud account, and boom... done.. But sometimes seamless is boring..Here's the things for you iPhone advocates you will have to do without.. lets get that out there now.(I have a iMac, MacBook, two ipads, wife has iPhone, AppleTV etc... all connected under one account)- iCalendar is gone on this phone. You can access a very mundane version of it through the phones IE browser, but it's impossible to read, zoom out, navigate, or add / edit events- iCloud storage is gone. There is no storage access with Apple's iCloud, completely different system- The beloved iMessage is gone. If you have friends on the iMessage system, they better get used to the old &#34;green&#34; text and using cellular to get in contact with you. No way around that unless you use apps like facebook, whatsapp etc...- Photostream is gone- And a bunch of obvious things because it's Windows, not AppleNow here is why I LIKE this phone- The screen is gorgeous. Hands down, best screen on the market, 6&#34; full 1080p deliciousness- 20MP Cam with 1080p. The picture quality is ridiculous. And paired with the Nokia Creative app, you can bust out some almost pro-like DSLR type photos with high quality video- The phone itself. For being such a monstrosity of a phone, it feels great to hold. Landscape view is awesome, and it actually fits my pocket just fine (I'm a dude who wears pants, no murse)- The live-tiles, OS, and navigation is top-bar quality. The phone is just fun to navigate through, and with high quality apps. (Weave, MixMusic, News etc...) The ability to rearrange to your liking from size, colors, live tyles, backgrounds etc is awesome. The updates on the tiles are a plus, one thing you don't have with iPhone (widgets for Android comes to mind). Easily spot weather updates, any news.. updates to facebook etc..- CPU. This thing is fast.. opening apps, switching between apps, it just so responsive and barely has a hiccup- Games / Video etc... Gaming is great on this thing. If you're an XBOX ONE user, using this as a second screen is pretty sweet. The games for the phone itself are pretty quality, look great, and the extra space with the screen size is a plus. Watching videos on this thing is on par with your quality tablets out thereIn conclusion.... Though this is a step away from what I'm used to with Apple, it's been a welcome change. I've tried Android and could not get into, and did not like it all. This however, being windows based, has been pretty awesome. And so far I'm satisfied. If you are a iPhone user, I don't think the transition will be bad unless you were a heavy cloud user, you'll have to switch from everything Apple based, to Windows cloud based (onedrive, sky drive.. etc...). All in all superb phone, definitely will hang onto this one for a year, until the next thing lol.. Not powerful at all, it does have two ports but you definitely CAN NOT charge a tablet with this thing, Not powerful enough, it would take days.... I purchased for a friend with a Note III who was jealous of the wireless QI charging on my Nexus 5. I was skeptical at first but my concerns/ worries were unwarranted. Installation was breeze and worked without issue on the first try. He now has several Qi chargers located throughout his home and office and loves his Note III even more. Devices like this are needed and well received when they work as stated. I would recommend this to anyone with Note III that wants the wireless charging feature that should be standard on all phones. First off, this product actually works really great, and feels nice and smooth, It wipes away fingerprints with ease and the sizing and cutouts are nearly perfect. What really makes this items a non-starter or a deal breaker for me was the fact that it left behind a huge bubble. It's actually not a typical bubble as you would think. I've tried to push the air out of it, but it appears that it is not an air bubble. It's actually a QA issue in that there is no adhesive or whatever on that portion of the screen protector causing it to make no contact and thus leave the appearance of a bubble. It's very similar to the bubble issues and images that many others have posted. Its such a shame because it would have been 5 stars without it. I'll try and post pictures when I can get my hands on a camera that isn't my phone. Not as powerful as advertised.  Even on an efficient chipset like the Qualcomm 800, if you're navigating on google maps and playing google music... you will be lucky if you can GAIN a charge, in my experience, even with only one device plugged in, i stayed even and occasionally lost a few percentage points in battery over the course of an hour or two. I have a Buick Encore and two iphones and they both charged up a bit faster than one iphone in my usb port.  We were travelling so I used the iPod in usb and charged both phones with no problems.  No problem with fuses on the car either.  I am happy with this charger because I have gotten rid of the poor quality, red phone cord I used to use.  It is nice to end the discussion of who's phone has lowest charge and gets to charge first.  Recommend to anyone that might have that problem because this charger will solve it. Cool product! Helps with fitness You get what you pay for, i liked it. It does the job, but by far is not fast. I like it. Thankfully both batteries last a long time The cable charges the phone fast. It's the right size I guess. Recommended This item &#8211; after reading more reviews than I care to admit on the many choices available &#8211; was purchased mostly for travel.  I decided against purchasing one which had the prongs directly attached to the unit as I wanted the ability to have my phone next to me versus across the room on the floorAfter a solid week of use, I can say this device worked very well.  It feels very durable, the USB cords fit snug without the wiggle room I have experienced in the past with others, and seemed to charge everything in the normal amount of time.  I will skip the more technical aspects for this review as others have covered them quite nicely.Quick Overview1 &#8211; Feels very solid with a nice &#8220;heft&#8221; to it.  It may sound silly, but having it weigh something meant it would not be pushed around and off of furniture easily.2 &#8211; I like the feet at the bottom.  Basically, you are not going to push this off with a simple nudge.3 &#8211; The prongs fit tight into the wall outlets.  This main sound like a trivial item to comment on, but you will not think so if you have ever purchased something which slid easily out of the outlet.4 &#8211; The USB ports fit all of the cords very tight.  I never was worried about cords becoming loose and not charging.5 &#8211; The blue light on the device is fairly bright and cannot be adjusted.  I would not say it is overly bright to where one cannot sleep; just that it is brighter than I expected and may bother those which want a fairly dark room.6 &#8211; If you own a tablet which requires a higher output (in our case &#8211; ASUS Transformer TF700T), it will not charge the device.  It will charge the Nexus 7, Kindle Fire, my netbook/tablet from ASUS, and any iPod / phone I threw at it.In an email from the manufacturer, they advised they have updated the light and two of the ports and have invited me to test it.  Upon receipt I will test the updated device and will adjust my rating as appropriate (if they improve #5 & #6, I will make it 5-stars).Regardless of any fixes, I like this charging station and would recommend it to anyone looking for such a device. Nice to have one unit to charge iPad 4, iPad Mini, Android phones (different brands) and Samsung Tablets. Charges all of them pretty fast.Negative? One of the ports was dead out of the box so its been returned. Love it just what I needed. Keep on end table with all my toys. I love it!! It's very fashionable and I got Many complements about it!!! Although not very protective.... Bought this extra for my car.  works great and I like it a lot.  Now I don't have to take my home cable with me all the time when running out.  I'm buying another one. This receiver does not work on some Qi chargers. great case ... daughter loving it best value/money phone out there, you basically get an s3 mini for a 100 bucks with a case screen protector and earplugs for 90 bucks, u just cant beat that Works ok, it was falling off every so often now it's not This product is great!!!  It feels really thick and seems to protect the screen very well.  It is easy to put on if you watch the video.  The only drawback was that it takes 12 or more hours to dry.  That wasnt a big deal really as I just did it before bed and it was ready when I got ready to use it the next morning.  I would definitely recommend this product. Package arrived, Case was included.... BATTERY WAS NOT!!  Very frustrating! Took no time for the ear hook to break and call quality was lacking.  Would definitely not buy again.  Even in a quiet environment right next to my phone, people complained about either background noise, sounding metallic, or echo I never could get a good fit where it would stay put against my cheek.  This kills the effective of the headphone and then people complained I sounded a million miles away constantly.  Would not recommend or purchase again obviously.  I have been using the Plantronics Voyager Edge and fit and call quality is night and day.  I've used that headset daily for the last few weeks and have yet to have anyone complain.  I use my headset daily for multiple hours....easily up to 4 to 6 hours a day depending on my meeting schedule. This is an extremely useful gadget to have in your bag if you are traveling though different parts of the world.  It can handle pretty much any plug and convert it to work in the United States, Australia, Europe and the UK.  It does NOT convert voltage so make sure you know that whatever you are plugging in can handle the local voltage.The two USB ports allow you to charge two devices at the same time you're using the plug on whatever electronic device is plugged into it.  The fact that this block is only about twice the size of a normal USB charger is pretty impressive for the functionality that you get here.The bottom line is if you're traveling you'll be happy that you have this device with you.I was provided with a sample for the purposes of doing a fair and honest review. I don't know who thought this one up, but it's brilliant.  Here's a charger that can be used almost anywhere in the world.  Frequent travelers should be thrilled at this compact, lightweight alternative to carrying around a lot of adapter plugs, or having to beg them from the hotel.  Move the lever one way and you can use this in the US, another, and it's a Europe-ready adapter, a press of the button lets you charge your electronics in the UK.  The manual is fairly good at showing you how to use the thing.It is not a converter, though.  According to the manual, if  the voltage where you're at is different from that of the thing you need to charge, you'll need a voltage converter in addition to the adapter.  Check before you plug in anything anywhere!The only quibble I have is that it feels a bit flimsy to me.  I suspect that's the trade-off for it being light and fairly cheap. Broke in a while. The e-thinker 2.5d is way better. Great price and Great value!  with this charger I won't have to carry extra charger cords in my purse!  Just pop out the low batter and swap them out  and it has a blue indicator light to tell you when its done charging so it won't overcharge the battery! The case arrive on time, fits perfect to my iphone 5s, the case's material looks resistable, look forward to have this case for a long time I always love hearing people asked me if they can borrow my wall socket to charge their phone. It happens all the time to all of us but it happens a lot less with this case. For my test is more than double your battery life for your iPhone and that is a big deal. And so many of my friends fail to close out their background applications so their battery goes even quicker. If you're somebody who's constantly dealing with needing to recharge your iPhone by this case now.Another thing is nice about these cases is they offer some really nice protection especially if you drop your phone on the back. Now that iPhones have a glass back I see more of them shattered in the front. Plus I like the grip that the larger case provides as sometimes I think iPhones are little too slim nowadays.I uploaded a few pictures so you can see the kickstand for propping your phone up and also what comes in the package.I highly recommend this case and it makes a great gift so keep that in mind around the holidays. Plus at the time of writing this review it was under $40.  To me that's just insurance and would justify the price when it saves your keister five times.Thanks for reading! Fantastic screen protector. Put on my LG G2 and it was just about perfect. Reccomend it Bought this for a friend. He says it fits perfectly for his Galaxy Ace with no case This is the ultimate girly case, pink and sparkly. Many of my girlfriends always want to pink iPhone case; well I have found the ultimate case right here. If you're looking for iPhone case that's pink this is the one to get.  Plus it's only four dollars and the time of writing this review that is a steal IMO. I have purchased pink cases off Amazon for more than twice that. I'm actually very impressive they can sell it for that cheap.Anytime somebody tells me they want a pink case this is the one I'm going to tell them to buy.Thanks for reading. My impressions so far of this product are very good. It feels sturdy in my hands, It is comfortable to wear because of the shape, and padding in the right places. It was difficult to pair with my Windows Phone, but that is just because this is my first experience with Bluetooth audio, ever, and I had no idea what pairing mode was until I looked it up. I am no audiophile, but I think this headset qualifies as good audio quality. For those with larger heads, (like me), it is adjustable. I predict that this will do perfectly for what I need it for, (mostly listening to music, and occasionally a call), and more. (Writeup by grandson who received these as a gift.) We live in the age of the Bluetooth speaker. Everyone needs to have one. I have several. From the trusty Jawbone Jambox to the exotic and expensive Harmon/Kardon esquire, as well as cheap generic speakers, there are a lot of options out there. While the Jambox sounds good, it is overpriced and only the very expensive Big Jambox is worth getting if you want to get any decent bass out of it. This new Spracht Conference Mate is advertised as a conference room speaker, and it does work well for that purpose. However, when playing music, I was surprised at how clean in sounded from such a small device. The downward facing &#34;subwoofer&#34; is actually able to produce a respectable amount of bass at moderate volumes (try in a corner for best results) and overall I have been very happy with the way this speaker looks and sounds. You need to consider the cost before being too critical, and for under $100, I feel this speaker performs very admirably. The battery seems to last several hours or more depending on volume, and it's very portable and easy to take on the road if you need a little extra volume for a speakerphone call.I really like using a speaker like this in a hotel room for some background music, especially if the room has loud neighbors. It's not so loud that it's annoying, but it's loud enough to mask any undesirable noises that may be present in the area. Overall I am very happy with this speaker and will recommend it to my friends who are looking for a nice but affordable bluetooth speaker for music or conference calls. They sent me the wrong cover. It was supposed to be for the Galaxy S5 not the iPhone and I waited a LONG time to receive it. Very disappointing. So, I have used Android phones for many years and this past January decided to give Windows Phone a chance. Well, first of all, when I started out using it, I thought, It's not THAT bad. Sure, there are a few apps here and there that aren't available but no big deal. Then I went to Chicago for a first time visit and not having the Uber app? Actually it was a big deal. (I actually had to send that phone back for a replacement because of a weird bluish spot in the screen.)7 months later my frustration came to a head and I switched back to Android. Here's the takeaway, IMHO, about Windows Phones, particularly the Nokia Icon...If you decide to use a Windows Phone get used to seeing these messages:Something went wrong.Sorry, cannot post to Facebook at this time.Wi-Fi unavailableYou exited the Facebook app so picture cannot be posted.Cannot load data at this time.Refreshing.Loading.And etc, etc. The biggest pro is that the camera on this phone is FANTASTIC. I mean, I will REALLY miss the quality of the photos this phone takes. But it's sad that a flagship phone can't even do something simple like posting directly to a friend's wall on Facebook. Or if the screen goes into sleep while you are waiting for the 5 minutes for it to upload a photo, the process will be canceled. Or the constant over-heating that happened with both of the phones. Or the incredibly bad wi-fi connection issues both phones had. Did I mention the battery? Bla....charge at work, home and on the road because that battery won't make it very far. I loved Nokia back in the pre-smart phone days and I guess I was hoping that allure of the brand would guarantee a great experience but unfortunately it hasn't.So, in comparison, I'm back on Android. Within the first few days of having my new Android phone I've noticed that when I go to share a photo to Facebook, I click &#34;Share&#34; and then choose Facebook and write whatever about the photo and press upload and....it's done. No, &#34;loading&#34; no &#34;refreshing&#34; no nothing. IT JUST WORKS. The connectivity to our wi-fi? Perfect and never drops it. All those apps, including Uber? Downloaded. Battery? Amazing! (of course that depends on what size battery your phone comes with but still.) And of course, there's the welcoming arms of Google. And frankly for someone who uses gmail it's really a no-brainer to have an Android phone because of all the integration with Google Drive, calendars, etc. Some things I have actually found in the market from Microsoft that I really liked, such as OneNote and OneDrive (which has all the awesome photos I took on the Icon). So I was glad to be able to port over a few Windows Phone features that I enjoyed.So here's the deal. For myself, I found that in the end there just isn't any reason big enough for an Android/Google user to switch to a Windows Phone. It wasn't a HORRIBLE phone by any stretch of the imagination, but it was certainly a frustrating platform that felt very buggy, lots of issues and frankly not worth the frustration for a &#34;flagship&#34; phone. I think for a first-time user a Windows Phone would be an ok one to start out with. But for most of us, there just aren't enough reasons to switch.I hope for the best for MicroSoft and I really miss the old days of Nokia. But looks like I'm gonna be in the Android camp (and very happily so) for the conceivable future. Its a pretty decent case. Sturdy. The mint color stained VERY fast. Other than that, its pretty good. Loved the case. Not bulky, clean look to it. Shipped in timely manner. Really nice case. Would recommend. The case looks great but it was way too slippery even compared to their lesser Slim Armor case.  It provides great protection because I definitely dropped my phone and it survived without a mark or scratch but I don't intend to keep testing that function so it went back day 2. Love this case!! It's slim and stylish - makes my S5 look like the new gold one they just released. And it provides great protection! Better than their other Tough Armor case which I found way too slippery.  It's a great color and it's nice and slim and doesn't need to be removed when I charge my phone in the dock I also purchased on Amazon.  I got great compliments and recommended it to 4 people in one day! Not nearly as fast as it should be for the specs it has.  Has weak signal strength compared to a Moto X (which is known for having phenomenal reception however), also slightly weaker at holding a signal than a Nexus 5.  You cannot get a better camera or performance in a phone this size on Android or Windows, and certainly not a waterproof / dust proof one.  If you're buying just for the camera, go for a iphone or Nokia Lumia 925. needed extra one...great! If you're picky about covers than I suggest the Spigen Air Cushion model with either black or grey edges for gunmetal phones.  This cover looks cheap, bulky and has a light yellowish hue.  However it's not a bad product for those who are minimalist when it comes to design and focus more on safety. Got the ballistic glass. Haven't attempted to scratch it yet but I can tell this glass is strong. Smooth too. Very quality. Easy to apply because it includes everything you need for cleaning and application. Zero bubbles. Good case. I like it Nice, sturdy case for my wife's S5.  She likes color an material, great for the price.  Adds real protection, not really thick, although not what I would call thin either.  Solid case though! love it! I love this cover.  It is cute and the color is very vivid.  I havent dropped my phone since putting it on so I cant speak for how well it protects but I believe it will do the job. the wife likes it but wishes phone may falles the snap was made with velcro as the case opens rather easy an she is afraid the may fall out. Simply a fantastic protector. I work on cell phone towers for a leaving, lots of steel and lots of concrete. I am constantly sitting my phone on my lap and then getting up and watching it bounce across concrete slab. I read lots of reviews and don't contribute even time to writing. I thank those that do write - you have saved me tons of money! Let me help you save some money= stop looking for other tempered glass protectors and buy this one!I dropped my phone a week ago and watched (in what seemed like slow motion) as my galaxy 5 twisted in mid-air and landed on the corner of a concrete slab right in the middle of the screen.... NOT EVEN A SCRATCH on the screen! Combined this with a LUVVITT Case (great fit), combined with the fact the s5 is water resistent and I basically have a very well protected phone Bought multiple multiple skinomis... Superb company and product. Buy at will Unfortunately this star rating thing doesn't have an option for &#34;I don't know because I sent it back&#34; or something like that. I got the watch and the screen protector at the same time. I never opened the screen protector pending my decision to keep the watch or not after trying it out. I didn't keep the watch so I can't help with any review on the screen protector. I received the Elitetech Premium Galaxy Note 3 screen protector.  It was very well packaged in a heavy cardboard wrapper.  The contents came with 3 screen protectors, a detailed instruction card, 4 screen cleaning tabs and a large red cleaning cloth.  The instructions were pretty simple and clear.  Unlike other screen protectors, I didn't need to use any water or spray solutions in the application.  However, I've found it is a little easier to apply any screen protector under a humid environment, so one tip is to install it in the bathroom with the hot water running in the shower to moisten the air. There were no bubbles present after the protector was in place.  Although 3 protectors are included in the package, it also comes with a lifetime guarantee from the manufacturer.  There is a cutout for the home button and for the upper part near the camera and mic.  The protector does not interfere with operating the touch screen.  Overall, an excellent product that will protect the Note 3's screen from scratches. Good case. I like the case. It really isn't made for the Galaxy S5 as it states. The cord is not made for this phone. You have to use the part that goes into the plug. Wireless charging is awesome. I also like the thickness that was added on the cover. It now protects the camera and lays flat on a table. Added bonus. Only issue so far is that there are no protective cases for it. Love it!! Fits great!! Put this case on and the phone slipped right out of my hand. Thankfully the protection is great on this case but I don't want to test that daily!  Way too slippery for me so it went back in 2 days. I just received it and it has already cracked down at the bottom next to the botton hole. And I have not dropped it. Delivered without the recharger.  I had to order a 2nd one. I love it This USB wall charger is compact and lightweight and has non-polarized plugs that fold for travel.  It is less than 2 1/2 in. long.There are two ports, marked for 1 A and 2.1 A, and they can be used at the same time for a total output of 3.1 A.  There is a blue LED indicator for power.When in use, it gets warm but not hot.  It charges as fast as any other wall adapter that I have tested.It is packaged in a reusable zip-lock bag.Seagle provided a charger for evaluation and review. The LyveHome Photo and Video Manager is not named properly. It should be named the LyveHome Photo and Video storage device, it doesn't manage much. It is a very compact device, just about the same screen size as my Samsung S4 and only about 4 inches deep so it take up very little space wherever you may place it. The set-up was very easy, step by step on screen instructions and you are set up in about a minute.The issue I have with the device is that it is all or nothing for syncing your photos. As soon as you connect your device to the LyveHome all of your photos sync, you have no option to choose which photos you can upload. If you want to delete photos from the device, you have to go to the on-line app to do so, and it only works with iOS at the moment. Once deleted from the on-line app you then have to remove the photos from your phone that you do not want on the LyveHome device. You would think for $300 a user would have the flexibility to pick and choose what photos they wanted to sync. Also - the photos scroll by and you cannot stop on just one photo and when you turn the device on it's side to look at a photo that was taken in landscape, the screen does not move.I spoke with one of the customer service reps about the lack of customization and he said they were &#34;working on it&#34; but had no time table. Over all, a pretty screen and great if you want every single photo you have on your device (s) synced. For me, and for $300 I would wait for better, more flexible software. There are many USB wall chargers on the market today.  Amazon even makes and sells their ownsingle port wall chargerat a cost of $20.  TheEachine 3.1A 15 Watt Dual Port USB Wall Chargergives you lots of options with 2 USB charging ports capable of a total of 3.1Amps for about half the cost of a single port charger with less power from Amazon.This charger has a very `Apple-like' feel to it.

With both a 1A and a 2.1A charging port, this charger works great for charging both a Smartphone and tablet at the same time.  The Eachine also features fold up wall prongs making it easy to transport and store.  I tried this charger with my Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD with no issues.  I also tested it with each respective tablet and my Smartphone at the same time with no charging issues.Overall, theEachine 3.1A 15 Watt Dual Port USB Wall Chargermeets a great balance between fashion and usability.  It has a very sleek design and has a lot of features to give you options down the road.[Review Sample Provided For Evaluation and Review] I work partially from home and use this along with an IPhone 5.  I'm on my phone an average of 20 to 40 hours a month (have to track it for work reasons).  This is the first headset I've owned that no one can tell I'm using a bluetooth headset and think I'm just on the normal phone.I like the fit and with the over the ear loop, it stays put.  I think the background noise works pretty well.  Best example I can give is I was talking to my wife on it and my wife didn't think I was home since she never heard our dog who gets very excited to see us and is quite vocal:)I have experienced one flaw but found a work around (hopefully this will be fixed) as it would make the Headset useless if you didn't know how to resolve it.  Some times it doesn't want to recharge normally.  The only way I can get it charging again is to plug it to the computer with headset turned off.  Push the voice and call button for a second which drops its connection to the computer.  I then turn the headset on and the computer sees and it starts charging.  I can then turn off the headset and it stays connected to the computer and charges no problem.  Thus the knock of one star.Works better than the Bose for me and far better than the Jawbone ERA.It recharges very quickly (don't have an exact time).  I do get the advertised talk time from the headset.  Only headset I've owned where people haven't complained on any call so far about sounding too far away, metallic, or the background noise. Got this from Best Buy and have been very happy.  I use it every business day and have had it for over a month now.  It is very clear for me to hear the people I'm speaking to, and they report that my voice is clear, including the several people who found it hard to understand me with my last headset.Battery life is strong. The people who complain that when it says it has an hour left, it really has less, are wrong. It is just that once you hit the hour mark, it repeatedly reminds you that it needs to be charged.Also, I had an issue where it seemed to stop charging, but Plantronics customer service help me. They are open 24 hours a day. The fix was to let the battery drain until it turned off by itself and then fully charge it. After following this advice, not only has it worked perfectly, but it made me realize that the unit was always fully charging, but. It would still report as being low battery.There are times when it seems to unsynch with my phone, but I think I determined that the cause is setting the headset right next to my phone when I'm not on a call. I'm not sure, but it seems that as long as my headset remains 6 away, it remains connected.The feature where it automatically answers the phone when you pick up a headset may sound unimportant, but it really is great, as is the ability to give verbal commands. The carrying/charging case works well and is very useful. Ten thousand mAh is monstrous for a battery power supply in this price range.  I bought this thing to power my Mobius Action Cam when I'm out hiking or biking for more that the Mobius's paltry 80 minute battery life.  This thing will power a Mobius for weeks, or charge my phone about a thousand times.  The instructions say it should take over six hours to fully charge, but I can charge it from my laptop USB in 4.5.  This thing is a great value. I love this! Fits my Note 3 perfectly and where my cd player is located with this in place it's at a perfect spot in my SUV for viewing. I was worried about sticking anything into my CD player (leased vehicle!) but it doesn't seem to be causing any problems. two batteries and a charger - can't beat the price! Great concept, and I thought my husband might like to try this. It works on his phone when the screen is locked too- so that is pretty simple. No complaints here, we just need to check the app features out more often. I would recommend this if your someone like my husband who only uses this to access his camera when his phone is in the locked position. It is almost scary how well the iOttie 2 sticks to surfaces.  The suction works well and the base is not moving anywhere.  I would be careful with sensitive surfaces.  The arm works well, but keep in mind that this is made for phones and will not be able to hold heavier items like GPS units.  The suction is strong enough, but the arm is not.  The gripping elements make it easy to pop the phone in and out and work best with phones that are relatively wide.  I would prefer that they grip a bit tighter for smaller phones.For phones the size of the iPhone or wider, the iOttie 2 works well, and the suction puts other mounts to shame.Thanks to the company for a review unit. The Pure W3 is a handy and convenient battery bank to have around in case of emergencies.  The battery is lithium ion so you can charge and store it.  Lithium does displace some power, but slowly.  I used this battery bank and tested it out with my iPad Air and Samsung Galaxy S2.The battery bank is quite small, and resembles a pack of cigarettes.  There are 2 outputs, one labeled Out 1A and the other out 1.3A.  A micro usb cable is included.With a full charge on this battery bank, I was able to charge my iPad Air (in airplane mode), from 58% to 100% in a little under 4 hours.  I was able to then charge my Galaxy S2 (Tmobile radio on, wifi on, no apps running) from 17% to 100% in under 2 hours.  It still had some juice left to charge my wife's phone, which is also a S2.  The battery bank never got hot while charging my devices.I was only able to use the port labeled Out 1A to charge the iPad Air.  Both ports work for my phones.  The bank comes on instantly and charges once you plug your devices in.  There is a white button that you can press to see how many out of 4 dots of power there is.I was also able to use a wall usb outlet to recharge this device.  That is fantastic as I do not always have my pc on.It's a fantastic device that does its job and does it well.  I am constantly on my phone checking stock quotes and it drains my battery on my S2.  Now when I am out and about, I just make sure I have this with me in my shoulder bag.It is a great product and I would recommend it.Disclaimer:  Sample provided for review Magic Cube reminds me of the blocks on Minecraft, except this block plays music and takes phone calls.Pairing with Bluetooth is ultra easy with my HTC One. Reconnecting is even easier. The range is pretty good. I can go at least one room away and still get a signal.Phone calls are very clear. The person on the other end can tell I'm on speaker but there is good clarity and no echos nor static on either end.  How do I know this? I tested it from both sides. Conversations flow freely without the need for either party to repeat.Music is good. I had the phone volume and speaker volume turned up to maximum. It was loud, but it didn't hurt my ears. I'd say it's good for personal use or a small gathering.This product was provided for review by Weiheng. Great protection for my phone and fun colors too. I love that it's still slim enough to put in my pocket and I'm confident I won't break my phone the next time I drop it. I love Fosmon products and keep coming back to them over and over. This case rocks!! It has the brushed aluminum sides so my phone doesn't slip out of my hand and it looks great.  Then it has the rubber protection needed to protect against drops.  I wish you could just order the different colored metal frames so I could switch them up but for the price, I can just order another one or two.  It has a nice slim fit so there's no additional bulk except for at the charging port which unfortunately makes me have to remove it to fit in my current charging stand but it comes off and on easily enough.  The gold frame looks better than the S5 gold that just came out in my opinion and as I stated before, it's not so smooth that it slips out your hand.  That's a bonus for me since this is my first phablet.  I thought phones were supposed to get smaller, not bigger. works great with my s5 and delivery was fast I love how clear this protector is a great product and easy to put on I purchased these for my son's phone. It was easier to put on than some previous products I used (no bubbles).The price was great for 3 screens. Perfect fit for my phone. Easy to apply and it great protection for my screen. I like the microfiber cloth included. I highly recommend. This does not charge my Samsung Note 2 as advertised.  My Note 2 shows that it is charging but it slowly discharges while being used with GPS.  This morning I started at 99% and in 40 minutes I was at 92%.  I have also tried it from other outlets but no use.I would not recommend this for a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.I am returning it. Nice, compact size and easy to carry for travel. I've been using this in my shower for weeks now and its awesome! The sound is perfect and it's small enough to stay out of my way in my super small shower. Fit and sound are great. Best BT in-ear headphones I've found thus far, and I've tried them all. Big improvement over the 903+. The only negative is the arm band. Clearly, Plantronics was catering to the iPhone folks because my Galaxy S5 will not fit. So when the iPhone 6 comes out with a larger screen, they'll have the same issue. Dumb. Very nice, inexpensive screen protector for your iphone 4,4s. Can't tell the difference between my actual screen and this. Goes on easy and bubble free! Super easy to install and lays completely flat and stays where you put it! Hasn't shattered and protects my screen completely! Great product! I don't know how I took pictures before I got this it is such a great product...would make a great gift for any picture takeer Needed the extras and love the fact that cords are different lengths for the right space. Short cord in car and long cord for wherever I need it. Outstanding screen protector!  In the past several years I've been using the ZAGG screen protectors for my iPhones, iPads, i-everything...and far be it from me to say anything negattive about my ZAGGS (except for the recent applications, which have been a nightmare...).This Micra went on like a champ!  Like my old PDA protectors! It just lay right down like it wanted to take a nap on my screen; no bubbles, no troubles. I've been using it for a month now, and the only downside I can see is that it's a bit difficult to take photos in bright light.This is definitely your best choice if you are finding the wet-application or squeegee application screen protectors unsatisfactory. Highly recommended space saver for home or on the go!!!! i have multiple devices including tablets/phone's and cameras so this unit takes care of all my charging needs with 1 simple to use unit. in the package was 4 port charging station/detachable power cord (4ft) OTG cable (more on its use) instruction manual and a warranty card.  the unit has 2 x Smart Charging Ports (Max 2.4A) 2 x Universal Charging Ports for Phones (Max 1.5A) 1 x OTG Port which allows instant read/write/view access to any USB storage from Android devices. (Need to use provided OTG cable) unit also has over-charge protection, surge protection and short circuit protection which was a very nice feature not found in all units of this type.another added feature was AC 100 - 240V input voltage and portable palm size (4.3&#34;*3&#34;*1.3&#34;) make it ideal for international travel which also other units are lacking. the OTG or &#34;on the go feature was a great added bonus and such a huge reason to purchase this unit, devices supported by OTG are: &#8226;Samsung:Galaxy S2/3/4;Note2/8;Galaxy Tab 3 8.0/10.1(Android OS 4.2 or later)&#8226;Nexus 5/7/10(Need to download StickMount on the market if you have root access;if you don't, download &#34;Nexus Media Importer&#34;)&#8226;ASUS memo pad;Asus Vivo Tablet;Kindle Fire;HTC One m7;HTC evo 4g LTE;Dell Venue 8 Pro;Lenovo lynx;Lenovo A2109 tablet;Xoom ;CM9 HP touchpad;Nvidia Shield;Motorola Xoom should note that OTG function can NOT be used on any Apple devices&#8226; Android devices needs to be updated to 4.2 or later to work with OTG function&#8226; OTG ports and OTG cable can NOT be used to charge devices&#8226; Use your device's original cable or a 3rd certified cable to charge you devices for safetythe 4 ports are named SMART (2) iphone (1) and ANDROID (1) which is kinda confusing and not really limited to whats listed. SMART. What that really means is that it can charge most tablets and smartphones but Do not let the labels fool you. You can charge any smart phone, cell phone, or bluetooth keyboard with these ports. i guess bottom line is it's 2 ports that are 2.4A MAX and 2 ports that are 1.5A MAX.. unit also has a nice blue led to show unit is getting power and ready for use. also all ports have an intelligent chipset that allows it to auto adjust the current to devices plugged in which is another added safety feature. i was able to charge 4 smartphones simultaneously across all 4 ports of this unit since they would be at or below the MAX current for each port.  in the end if you own multiple devices this is the unit for you, i gave it 5stars for price,function and features. This device is one small item that really packs a punch. It is able to charge all my family's smart phones at once or my cellphone (Samsung Galaxy Note S3) and My Tablets (Kindle Fire HDX and iPad Air ). It's all about the amps there are 2 smart ports forup to 2.4A (think ipads and tablets) and 2 ports for up to 1.5 amps (think smart phones). The OTG port CANNOT be used for Apple Products esp iPads.What's really unique about this little gizmo is that it can charge both a phone and a tablet in about the same time as having multiple chargers going and is much safer since you're not overloading your home w/ all these additional plugs (esp in summer months in the south where the electric companies are forever telling you to unplug items even on strips while storms are coming or the temperatures are unseasonably high and everyone is using their A/c).Most of these devices do not come w/ the OTG cable but that's not the case. The manufacturer has thought of everything by including the cord with this unit.People ask me what the OTG port does. (OTG for those of you who aren't too computer literate yet means ON THE GO).Simply stated it 1 x OTG Port: allows instant read/write/view access to any USB storage from Android devices. (Need to use provided OTG cable). Again this will NOT work on Apple Devices!!While the manufacturer doe label the port for an iPhone and one port for Android it is NOT limited to either one. What this actually tells you is that it these two ports together cannot exceed 1.5a!This item is extremely compact : portable palm size (4.3*3*1.3)and so this  makes it ideal for international travel or domestic travel. Either way it will fit very easily into a pocket of a tote bag or a fanny pack. Package includes: 1*charging station; 1detachable power cord; 1*OTG cable for Android; 1*User Guide.Make sure you take your user's guide just in case you have any questions.One thing that's invaluable to me is having 24/7 email customer support and HooToo is known for their outstanding customer support making it one of the best electronics companies on the market today. (Heck even Sony doesn't offer 24/7 customer support unless you pay for it..this is FREE).Most of these units don't have any safety features and yet this product is LOADED with them. Seems HooToo is all about Safety first! (Which for me when you have a family is an absolute must have).It has over charge protection, surge protection (heck my neighbor just lost a TV and a cable box by not having a surge protector on their box and tv..this to me here in the lightening capital of the world is fantastic), and it even has short circuit protection. Can you ask for any other protection? I can't think of anything that HooToo didn't cover. Oh yes..it does come with a 12 month HooToo Warranty and 24/7 email support.This device is compatible with ALL USB-charged devices with a few exceptions. The Asus Transformer and Ipod are NOT compatible with this device (but w/ the ipads and all the other phones like iphones etc this is still a winner for HooToo).One thing I did want to mention about Android Devices. In order for this to work with the OTG it MUST be updated to Android 4.2 or later. My Samsung Galaxy Note S3 worked fine..plug and go.Finally I just want to let you know about this device that the OTG function cannot be use to actually CHARGE the device only read.This device at even double the asking price on Amazon.com is worth every penny. It literally eliminated tons of extra charging devices and cords that were scattered all over my home. Simplicity and being able to keep up w/ the kids' devices and my own all in one place is truly a blessing.I was actually sent this device by the manufacturer to test and review. This review is my own and nobody including the manufacturer had any influence over my opinions or reviews. I used this with my ipod while mowing the grass and it works great. So far it has held up well and fits my arm perfectly. I'm very pleased! The perfect phone cover it is light weight...durable...and colorful....any girls dream Very sturdy and colorful ..I love it. I'm very clumsy and drop my phone a lot. Well, I  accidentally  dropped it again and there was no damage to the phone or the case..I highly recommend this product. This is a really nice slim fit case.  It fits very snug on my phone and looks very attractive.  It is a good quality case and the colors are very vibrant.  It makes my phone look like a rainbow. One of my favorite iPhone case makers does it again with this one. I like holding it. All the stingrays will be jealous of your new case. It's the most unique black case I've ever used. Good, well made product. This is a very trippy black case with a great feel. I love that it's a sting-ray. So frickin' cool. Ok, this is just too cool in all regards. It has a nice grip, strong design and looks like the classiest case I've seen. It's a durable case with a little flare for those who keep their class subtle, not flashy. You won't be disappointed to have a pony in your purse! Feels/looks super. This is a way cool case. I'm getting second-takes and compliments constantly. With a textured feel and a unique coat. Excellent ideas, folks. Love this fur. Feels awesome. If you like these type of patterns, you'll be pleasantly surprised to find you are holding the closest thing to the real animal- mainly because it feels like it. Another trippy case for your reptilian friends. Durable, it doesn't feel cheap like most mall cases I've seen lately. Reptile lovers will be impressed by the realism of this iPhone case. Prepare for friendly and curious glances from folks who see you using it. This is my favorite case in terms of feel. I'm sure it will also last a long time. What a cool idea. Punk retro texture!! Wonderful idea. Great idea and it works well. I love the feel of this one. A leather case is truly a treat. It also is staying clean as day 1. Kudos to this idea. Got this case for my spouse to go with his black iPhone. It looks amazing and is super easy to wipe off. Some of the other cases on the market would get dirty so quickly it was unreal. Cleaning them was another whole problem. With this case, it wipes off quickly and keeps his phone protected. A definite must-have. Another cool Valenz case. The pattern is why I bought it, but the feel is great. I've gotten in a habit of rubbing it back and forth like I'm petting some sort of friendly reptile. Great case design and feel. Ahah, I love it. The case looks better than the amazon photo, and it feels really really neat. As someone who owns an iPhone, I absolutely love this case. It has a brilliant color and stands out amongst all of the other cases out there. It works amazingly well to keep my phone protected. I am horrible about dropping my phone, but this case has helped to prevent it from getting damaged. I highly recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their phone and look amazing doing it. I don't like the word hate, so let's just say that there are two things that I *can't stand*.1)  I can't stand paying full price for an Apple Lightning cable.2)  I can't stand getting the message that this cable is not compatible with your device message.This cable is fantastic.  It is short, which I like.  (I don't need more than a couple of feet of cable coiled up on my desk.)  It charges well and doesn't give me the error.  Hooray!I like the black color of the cable and I like the nice substantial PVC coating.  This cable feels very sturdy and I'm confident that it won't fall apart like some of my other generic cables.  I suppose that with a name like Liger, how could you go wrong?  (Napoleon Dynamite would approve.)I was provided this item for review. It seems we never have enough cords to charge Apple devices.  This one looks like good quality, it's certified by Apple, and it's long enough to reach farther than the usual short ones.  We have used it on several devices, and it has been working fine. Got as a gift Cord won't work with my iPhone 5s I was very disappointed with this product the only thing that was of good quality was the package it came in fingerprints are hard to remove and it broke on me in a week into a bunch of small sharp pieces don't waste your money This is an extremely well thought out case. The buttons actually feel much better than the official bumper provided by Google. They're crisp, unobtrusive and clean up very easily. The back clear plastic allows you to see the design on  your phone. I had the white version which is less common, and it was nice to be able to show that off. A gimmick they advertise is that you can cut photos to size and insert them in the back. They include a cutting template for those who are interested. Not for me, but a nice afterthought.The rubberized plastic material can easily absorb shocks from 3-4 feet. The phone is held in very snugly, so you don't have to worry about the phone launching out of the case upon impact. The rubber quality also ensures that the case will not crack over time when removing your phone or repeated drops.There are little feet grooves that prevent the plastic from contacting flat surfaces when you lay your phone down. The front wraps around the phone's bezel to avoid the screen from contacting surfaces too. And it does not interfere with screen protectors.The audi jack is compatible with Pressy. Nice quality case.  I just prefer not to have the front cover over my phone. Okay, I got it today and was amazed!  This little thing is really astonishing  for the price.  I know a lot of people have complained about the looks of it. But, if you are someone like me who appreciates the human effort of the work put behind things and the care and compassion , then you won't mind the looks as much. The company built this watch with very little financial backing. They wanted it to be affordable and they wanted to make it computable with the iPhone and androids. They've done a beautiful job, the white looks so great, I'm not even going to cover it with the shin I bought for a long time. It' looks amazing just the way it is. Nice case, my husband loves it! Spigen products are the best I bought one for my htc one and loved it so I bought one for my iphone and it was better than the screen of the iphone Fantastic, the VERY BEST cover for your iPhone. Dropped it 3 days later and it absorbed the blow very well. Without it I would certainly have a cracked screen. Don't hesitate, GET IT NOW!!! "}
