I wasnt too sure about how the color would be because of how it may be projected depending on the different monitors but once I got it the case had the black outlining and the back was a beautiful light turquoise green. It was even better in person.It fits in all the right places. Very good quality, especially for the price! I love the time and effort they make to make sure we the customers are content with the product. They even have a Thank You note inside the box.I recommend this to anyone and everyone. I love my new case!"}

{"id": 9, "text": "The good:1) The magnet holds well and is very convenient, even on my Note 2 with an extended battery and case.2) The suction cup holds well on a perfectly flat and clean surface.The bad:1) The arm is very short which makes placement difficult to find in my car to keep it visible and in reach. I might have to find a flat surface round metal surface to stick onto my car with double sides tape to stick this mount onto to place it in a more visible location. A longer arm would have also solved this problem, or an extension that could be added.2) Because it requires a perfectly flat, porous free surface to stick to my car offers very few places to put this mount as most the surfaces are porous.3) It prefers to keep the phone in a portrait view, my preference is landscape (of course part of this problem may be due to the extended battery.4) Because its a magnet the phone move in position and may not stay in the same position you put it as you make turns or hit bumps, though it doesnt fall off.Overall, I had better hopes for this Im sure for the right phones with the right car with better mounting locations this would be a better mount for those people. So check your car to make sure you have a flat, non-porous, area to mount the cradle where you want to actually mount it in your car."}

The matte products keep their texture and keep looking great over time.  The fit is perfectly tight, providing the security of it not coming off (like gel cases) while still allowing you to remove it if needed.  Opening to ports on the phone are well designed to allow good connections without removing the case.  And they provide plenty of protective bounce if you drop your phone without ever cracking or compromising the stability of the case.  They also add a very impressive minimal amount of bulk for fantastic protection.  I highly recommend!"}

The sound is great for everything from music to movies, but my only problem is that they are very big and heavy.  After wearing them for more than about a half an hour the weight really starts becoming oppressive.  They irritate my ears and head and I have to constantly shift them to ease the pain.I love that they fold up so neatly into their own custom pouch and that the audio cable is removable so if you develop a problem with it (the cable is always the weak link on a set of headphones) you can simply replace it.  You do have to really jam the cable pin in very tightly when you use them or one of the sides sounds like its shorting out.  I noticed that a number of other reviewers had the same problem, but it is easily remedied by simply forcing the connection a bit.I really like these headphones - I would love them if they were a little more comfortable and a little more stylish.Cheers,ClairePS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.

Hopefully I can find a new original cable. I am using a straight cable now. The reviews that complained about cable fallout had to be the result of not inserting the end fully. The cable is very secure."}
{"id": 44, "text": "I can only assume they used a wire gauge that is too small or the cable isnt shielded because the phone charges much slower through this cable.  If the cable is too long and too fine, the voltage will drop over length and when the voltage drops too low the phone will pull less power for charging (it thinks the charger is at its max current.)Also I had difficulty getting my phone to sync on this cable.Its OK for lying in bed and using it while charging it overnight, but its not a good all around cable."}

As a result, I only achieve an &#34;acceptable&#34; result with one of the long side of the protector slightly lifted on my 4th try with my last protector. (Yes, I had to throw away my first two screen protectors after reapplying those so many times).My suggestion is to make the screen protector slightly smaller to leave more margin of error or tolerance for all the human being trying to apply the protector manually. A dust removal sticker will be a very helpful & considerate tool to include by the manufacturer given the high chance of having to reapply."}

{"id": 99, "text": "After reading several reviews for mounts, I finally settled on this one for my iPhone five (with bumper). The reasons for purchase were; trim design, one hand insert/removal of device, and super sticky suction cup. After now having used the mount for a couple months, Im starting to regret the decision. Let me first say that if youre using it on a windshield, youll have no trouble. The mounts stays nicely in place on the glass and holds the device firmly so that insert/removal of device is perfect. However, I dont want to use mine on the glass, which was a major reason I bought this one claiming super stickiness. I essentially have two locations where I can mount, one vertical and one semi-horizontal. The vertical location is almost smooth, but after about three insertions of the device, it loses grip and has to be re-attached. The semi-horizontal location is textured like leather and is essentially useless. Once the device is inserted, it falls within seconds. After following the directions, washing the suction cup and then swabbing the dash with rubbing alcohol, still no results. Finally, I used an extra suction disk I had from my gps, the kind that had double sided tape on the bottom and creates a perfect surface for mounting. Keep in mind that I have used these disks before to mount my gps and they work great for about 2 years, finally giving way to heat and vibration. As soon as I installed it this way I knew there would be problems. Once the device was first mounted, the backside of the suction disk was pulled away from the dash. It seems that the design of this mount is to blame; its high and forward positioning of the device, puts a great deal of lever force on the suction cup. My work around with the suction plate lasted 4 days and eventually gave in. So now Im left with cleaning adhesive off my dash, just like before. I think I may consider the iOttie One touch or the Easy flex 2 because the center of gravity seems to be better based on the pictures. Or I may keep looking for the next best thing. For now, Ill go back to mounting my gps and leaving my iphone in my pocket..."}

If you have ever snagged a headset cable on furniture or your hand and either ruined a headset or the device its attached to, you will understand the need.  If you ever went running and dropped your MP3 player and yanked your earphones out then you see the need for these.  But like any new technology there are tradeoffs.  Battery life, audio quality and device size seem to be the tradeoff here.  Battery life is ok with this bluetooth set but  at the expense of a large ckunky pendent then the earphones plug into.  For some odd reason the earphones that come with the Jabra Tag are unusually cheap and sound horrible.  You can plug in other earphones and the sound improves considerably.  Unfortunately the large pendant is so big it almost negates the benefits of wireless bluetooth.  Worse yet,  the FT receiver on these is low quality, has poor range and you have no way of seeing what frequency you are tuned to.[PROS][+] Easy to pair to bluetooth[+] Decent battery life[+] Good volume adjuster[CONS][-] Big[-] Cheap poor sounding  earphones[-]  Weak FM[-] Difficult to use FM Receiver"}

{"id": 124, "text": "My excitement lasted just one month with this extended battery for my Galaxy s3. For one month (from July 17-Aug 18), I could get to most of 2nd day before charging. Suddenly the last 3 days, my battery drains out by evening of 1st day. I rebooted phone, havent installed any new apps in the last week etc. The most used battery app is the screen - that has remained the same all the time. So this has to be the battery that has permanently lost most of the charge holding capacity. All within a month.I wanted to contact the seller first to give them a chance to fix it, but couldnt find email/link anywhere to reach out to them. Even the email they sent thanking for the purchase didnt have their email address (was sent via Amazon). At least include your support email address in your contact to me!The back-cover is nice and fits the phone well. But very disappointed with the battery itself.update (1 week later): I am updating this rating to 5-star due to (1) they contacted me quickly, sent me a replacement battery the same day and I have the new battery running for 2-3 days and holding up charge well. I give 5-stars for excellent customer service. I will check back in about 30-40days to see how the new battery holds up charge compared to the previous one. I am hoping for the better. Cheers.update 2 (Oct 30): the 2nd battery has proved to be quite a workhorse. It is sustaining charge quite well and functioning wonderfully! Thanks for a great product. The 1st battery might very well been a defective item. Great customer service. thanks a lot."}
{"id": 125, "text": "EC Technology Dual USB Output 16,800 mAh Battery Charger / B00CAMCCLQI was very excited to receive this battery charger free of charge from the manufacturer for review.  I have anAnker SlimTalk 3200mAh Battery Charger, which is slender and great for keeping my phone alive during the day, but even it cant keep my phone charged for more than one day, which is a problem for long trips. This EC TECHNOLOGY charger is a lifesaver, though I do want to note that it has a couple of quirks to be aware of.1: Size. This is a pretty big charger. You wouldnt want to put it in most purses, though it would be at home in a large laptop bag or roomy day-bag. Check the product dimensions before you order and make sure that your use-case for this backup can withstand the extra weight. I think its a good size for a travel charger, but your mileage will vary.2: Power Button. The one thing I dont really care for about this battery is that its not plug-and-go, you actually have to press a power button after you hook up your phone/tablet but before the battery will start charging it. (The button is easy to press with the ball of your finger.) If youre used to plug-and-charge batteries, this can take some getting used to; one time I plugged in my phone and grabbed it before heading out only to realize that Id forgotten to turn the battery on and my phone was near-dead.3: Overcharging. The other quirk is that the battery turns itself OFF when the phones/tablets attached to it are fully charged. Now, I get that overcharging a device is a concern for certain situations, but if you have a device that draws a lot of charge while idle (which my older model phone does), then this means that an overnight charge on this battery will go like this: your phone will charge up to 100% at or around midnight, the battery will switch off, and then your phone will seep charge for the rest of the night and youll wake up to a dead phone. Mmph. This is why I say I wouldnt use this charger for overnight charges -- unless your device doesnt pull a lot of idle charge or if youve switched it off ahead of time.4: Dual Output. This battery charges two devices via USB. Theres an output 1 and an output 2 slot, and one time it seemed like the Output 2 slot wasnt working unless the Output 1 had something charging on it. That seemed like a very strange design decision, though, so I tried it again later and it was fine. Im 99% sure that the problem in that case was that I hadnt plugged the cord into my device firmly enough, so once again the larger point here is to MAKE SURE your device is charging before you walk away. (See point #2.) Obviously this is true for any battery backup device.5: Display. The visual display is great in that it tells you (a) that the battery charger is on and charging and (b) precisely how much charge is left (not in 0/25/50/75/100 increments like my Ankar does, but rather in actual 79% numbers), but its also fairly bright. If you flip the battery over onto its front, there isnt much light-seepage.6: Performance. Im actually really impressed with the speed of charge on this battery. My benchmark tool for these things is the Kairosoft games on the Google Market -- I love them, but they suck the battery dry like an expensive vacuum cleaner. Ive found that I can plug my Samsung Skyrocket phone into the charger while it plays audio non-stop and plug my Samsung Note 8.0 into the charger while it plays a Kairosoft game, and the charger will still manage to (barely) keep up and keep inching both devices towards a net positive charge gain. Thats a REALLY impressive charging speed, given that Ive actually seen a Kariosoft game drain one of my devices while on a wall plug before. Of course, if you want a faster charge-up on this (or any) battery backup, the best thing to do is stop using your device, but its nice to know that you still can if you need/want to.7: Storage. The sheer amount of charge in this device is also impressive -- Ive had my phone on the charger with non-stop audio going for 8+ hours, and the tablet with a game going for 4-5 hours throughout that, and STILL have not seen the charger dip below 60%. I think I could probably get two full days of heavy use (or three days of light use) on this without charging the battery, but havent had a chance to test that yet.8: Accessories. Final point, this battery backup comes with its own cord and a variety of plug-heads to swap out. Ive only used it with USB-to-microUSB devices (and the battery itself charges via USB-to-microUSB into a USB wall plug weve installed in our home), but its nice to have the heads to swap out if anyone drops by with an iPhone in dire need of charging.Bottom-line, this is a great travel charger once you get the hang of using it, if you dont mind the added weight, and if you can either turn your phone off at night or have some other solution for night-charging (or if your phone idles extremely efficiently). I highly recommend it and Im glad that I had the opportunity to review it.NOTE: This review is based on a free review copy of this product.~ Ana Mardoll"}
{"id": 126, "text": "The EC Tech 16,800mAh battery pack is a lot of battery for not a lot of money. It includes a feature I wish every single battery sold had, a % charge number.The battery is rated at 16,800mAh with two USB outputs. I have an iPad 1 and an iPhone 4. The battery was able to charge my iPad from zero (or whatever the battery level is when the iPad turns itself off), an additional 25% to that iPad and two full iPhone charges. That is about the equivalent of 10,000mAh - or a good solid high percentage of the rated capacity. In fact the battery pack probably have the rated capacity; there are inefficiencies of charging as a battery is topped off the last 10% (that happened in three charge cycles).Bottom line, the battery capacity is fantastic in this unit for the price - at around $40 there isnt a much better deal for a battery this big. The battery can easily extend the iPad battery 1.5 times. Thats pretty darn impressive. I would expect about 8 or 9 charges for an iPhone.The great news, the two USB ports output high current and will charge devices at their high charge rate. I love that; so many batteries dont do this, they typically work at the medium charge rate level.The big bonus on this unit there is a small number in the LCD window that shows the percentage of battery charge left. In my experience, above 40% was incredibly accurate. At about 25% the battery could die out any moment. Most batteries have a little set of LEDs or bars to show roughly how much charge is left, they are really horrible to judge true charge level. This unit includes a quick glance set of bars in the display.I actually love just about everything on this battery. The power switch is recessed just enough that the battery wont start inadvertently; you have to deliberately press the button to turn on the unit to start charging. When the battery has some charge, it will do flow through charging when it is plugged in. This means the battery can be plugged into an AC adapter or a computer, and the device can be plugged into the battery and both will charge at the same time. This is a great feature for overnight charging. When the battery is at 0%, flow through does not work.This is a nice looking block. The brushed aluminum front is a nice touch in not showing fingerprints. The unit does not come with an AC adapter. The battery can be charged in most USB ports and with most USB AC adapters. It is probably wise to use the higher power AC adapters like that supplied with an iPad. The minuscule iPhone adapter works, but it takes a long time. The battery is not fast to charge, Ive left it charge overnight from 0% left. By morning it is at 100%. The charging port is a standard micro USB connector. I dont like those personally, however it is the de facto standard everybody uses now, so I cant argue anymore.The unit does not include an LED flashlight - I think the product description suggests it does. The LCD on the front panel is always lit up blue whenever the unit is on and charging a device.For the price, this cant be beat. Ive tested a lot of battery packs and this one is the first to have a % charge remaining in the display. I love that feature. This is a large capacity battery and as such they are usually kind of big and heavy. This one is no different. The package is slim and good looking, but it is still a chunk. It is roughly one and a quarter iPhones long, about 10% wider than an iPhone, and the thickness of two iPhones stacked up.I was provided a review sample."}
{"id": 127, "text": "This is a hybrid cover. I would NOT call it a case. It comes in two parts, a silicone insert with a hard plastic cover. It does fit nicely and protects the edges of the phone. It does protect the edges in case of a drop but that is all it does.  The pink is almost gray, not good or bad, just telling you what the color is like.

{"id": 129, "text": "Very nifty product. Anyone with mobile devices, especially cell phones, has the problem with batteries draining way too quickly. In the past I used extended life batteries for my cell phones and that helped a great deal but they made my phones bulkier and there were no cases available for these either.The Helix Power Bank is an easy-to-use device to charge my iPad and my cell phone at the same time and if need be, my husbands cell can be plugged in as well. It is small and compact enough to be taken along in my purse although it is not super-lightweight (9.4 oz on my postal scale - where Amazons product description gets the 0.3 oz weight from is puzzling).Charging is as fast as if I plugged my device into a regular outlet or USB port and the 4 green lights always give feedback on how much charge is left in the Helix. When it is drained, I just plug it into my computers USB port at night and it is ready to go again the next morning.For me, this means mainly peace of mind that I will not run out of juice unexpectedly - call me paranoid but occasionally I have these visions of being stranded by the roadside in a snowstorm and cannot call 911 because my phone is dead (even though that is very unlikely to happen where I live :-)). The Helix is a great little piece of insurance for those unexpected scenarios, snowstorms or otherwise... :-) 100 % recommend."}

{"id": 136, "text": "I have to applaud the unique packaging of the Jabra Stone 3.  In order to get to the headset the buyer needs to twist and turn the package several times in order to unveil the product. In the end, Jabra fools you though. In order to release the headset from the holder, the plastic forks must be squeezed from below. I didnt expect this and continued twisting until I became frustrated. In the end, one of the supporting plastic pieces broke off. I guess had I taken the time to look at the diagram, this would not have happened. Very unique packaging - nice one Jabra.When first handling the Jabra Stone 3, the light weight and small size become apparent. This definitely helps when the user wears the headset for an extended period of time.  Once you are done twisting, this is what you get in the package: A total of four different eargels, the charging stone, a short USB cable, and an AC adapter with a really short cord that has a mini USB connector on the end. Since most plugs are located at floor level or behind furniture, the length of the cord makes the adapter a little bit impractical, but it is good to have. Most people will just use the USB charging method anyway, especially in the car.In order to charge the Jabra 3 you need to have the charging stone, which also doubles as a portable cordless re-charger when the battery on the headset runs low. Some people find this annoying, I do not. I generally use the headset in my car, while occasionally walking around with it. Im not one of those people who seem to have grown a headset out of their ears. Keeping the charging stone in my center console (which also has a lighter socket that I added a USB converter to) when its not in use allows a convenient spot to put it back to as well as guaranteeing it will be charged for the next use.Pairing the device was easy. My iPhone found it right away, and automatically connects to it whenever it is nearby. No connection issues here. If your phone has NFC it will also pair if held against the NFC zone of the charging stone.The sound quality is ok on the Jabra Stone 3, but it does break up a little bit. I wish it had a little more bass to it, even for standard phone conversations.  It is lacking a little on the low end, and sometimes I find the audio to be a little harsh depending on who I am speaking with. I also find that it the Jabra is not quite loud enough.  I have both the phone and the headset up to full volume and find that it is at a slightly less loudness point than I would like, which means if I want to turn up the volume when a less than ideal quality call comes in I have nowhere to go. Adjusting the volume on the Jabra Stone 3 is pretty slick, simply swipe your finger up and down the piece.I just got off the phone with someone while using the headset, and they said they were having a hard time hearing me, in fact they said it sounded like one step up from Fischer Price. Oooo, thats not so good, and I was just sitting inside the house. Needless to say, I switched off of the Jabra and used the handset instead. Good thing I wasnt in the car.As far as talk time goes, if you press the side of the headset once, the lady tells you how much is left. Maximum talk time is two hours. The lady also lets you know who is calling when you have an incoming, that way you dont have to look at the phones display. You can even use the headset for Siri if you have an iPhone.  Supposedly it is possible to access contacts by voice control, but I could never figure out how this works, or find documentation on Jabras website or anywhere else.  The technology in this device is pretty good, I just wish it sounded better on both ends (I even tried switching to all of the different eargels, but that did not do the trick. Maybe the Stone 4 will be the one."}
{"id": 137, "text": "UPDATE (OCT 2013) : The slender part of the headset broke; i.e the ear hook part.Im not even sure how it happened; im very careful with my electronic devices and i was just putting it on as usual. Anyways im very disappointed...as i had gotten used to it too.ORIGINAL REVIEW ON AUG 2013:Ive had this headset for around a month now. It does some things i love and has some neat features but most people dont like it because of the battery (or lack thereof).Issues:-Battery: Whether you should buy this or not is really dependent on how much you plan to talk with it during a day. I dont talk much but keep the headset on and connected to my phone my whole workday...it is able to last me around half the day like this. Though with any talktime or other media usage it degrades tremendously fast. Listed time is 2 hours talktime and this is true.-Only one fit and only for your right ear.-Headset itself doesnt have a charge slot, thus you cant use it while its charging in its pebble.Positive:+no issues with sound quality and drops.+love the easy volume up/down (just slide your finger on it).+love that it tells me the name of the person calling ( tested and works on both iphone 4s and samsung galaxy s2) and i can just answer by saying answer.+only one fit but it fit me perfectly and was one of the most comfortable and smallest headsets ive used.+i personally think its easier to carry the pebble and the headset. They fit together perfectly and i dont have to deal with more wires."}
{"id": 138, "text": "I liked this boostcase and would recommend it.This case is very slim and easy to use. You put your iPhone in a minimalist hard plastic case that then snaps into the main battery pack. Overall I think this is a good solution: it cuts down on the bulk of some other case solutions I have tried, and makes it easy to use the iPhone either with battery or without it. I actually like the case-- its nicely styled and provides good back and some side protection, but no front protection. Its very goof proof to use: the battery turns itself on whenever you snap on the case and starts charging the phone until it hits 100% and then trickle charges as needed. Plug the battery case into its micro-USB cable and I was able to fully recharge it in about 3 hours.You could use this boostcase in a couple ways: you could always keep it on your iPhone and charge them both up overnight if you heavily use your iPhone and find that you are running short of power during the day (like I sometimes do if Im on vacation or in a city). Or, you could just keep the boostcase tucked in your briefcase or purse charged and use it as needed if youre running low.Only two minor drawbacks that drop this down to a four star review: #1 it wont charge the iPhone back to 100%. Tried multiple times, and when I was at 10-20% iPhone charge and put on the boostcase I would only make it up to around 80%. 80% is good, but would be nice to be able to fully charge the phone. Second, this puppy get HOT in your pocket when its charging the iPhone-- not burn you hot, but very noticeably warm."}
{"id": 139, "text": "I have been using this for several days and so are is very pleased with it.  It really does make a lot of difference allowing me to use my iPhone 5 all day long without charging until the evening.Aesthetically it is designed rather well and adds little bulk or weight to the phone and you get use to the increased size rather quickly.  Although like any of these battery cases one hand use is a little more difficult in reaching across the screen.The iPhone slips into a case snugly that that  is then used to mount to the battery pack.  It does take some effort to pull the phone and case back off the battery and it is obvious it is meant to stay with the battery pack.  Phone controls are easily accessed. Although the bottom part of the case means that most headphones will not be able to plug in without an adapter or headphones with a straight connection like the headphones that come with the iPhone 5.  A light on the back of the case indicates general battery level and when it is done charging.  When plugged in via micro USB the phone charges first and then the battery pack.In daily usage I have found I got about six hours of battery life before the phone starts to draw on its own battery.  My usage environment is to have the iPhone display on continuously with usage including GPS, internet activity via cell data, and other tasks that fairly quickly drain the battery over a day.  Before I could not go through the day without having my phone charging at some point.  Now at the end of the day I have more than 50% battery.While it includes a charging cable (typical micro USB) it does not include a power adapter to plug the USB in.  This was rather surprising.  While you could certainly plug it into any computer USB ports, typically these ports only supply 2.5 watts and will provide a rather slow charge.  Although since you wont need to use the lightning cable to charge the phone, you can use the Apple power adapter which does proved 5 watts for charging."}
{"id": 140, "text": "This case barely adds any bulk. And when it does, it fits the phone very well. Very snug all the way around. Protects the corners and back, and maybe helps with screen protection because of the way the lips extend outward. It is not complete protection though.When installing the case, ensure those three contacts are touching the three dots on the phone. You may have to adjust them a bit because this case has clearance for Europe. They have not made the us spec one yet.  Understand this before  you complain. It works great, and looks very good.The speakers are channeled through a groove in the case, and actually helps make it a bit louder. All the sound gets pushed out the bottom. Thanks! Much louder alarm clock now. Always loved the speakers on the bottom, (Z10, Lumia 920)Thanks for taking the effort Nokia. Your effort has paid off in top notch products and happy customers."}

{"id": 142, "text": "First off this lost one star because the lanyard included could not fit in the minuscule hole on the battery. It should have never been a feature. Now with that out of the way, there are a lot of positive features. I have had several portable batteries. They work well and can charge my iPHone, but none of them could charge my iPad Mini. The Mini did not recognize the charger even. This is designed with two USB ports-one for small powered devices and one for tablets. It is marked clearly on the battery which is for each. After fully charging the battery (the 4 lights show 100% on the battery), I plugged my IPad in. It had 22% remaining power. In four hours it had 89%. This is equivalent if not better than the wall charger it comes with. I also had 25% of the battery power left. I could give my iPhone another 30% with this. I did not try to charge both at the same time, but this battery could do that. That is a great feature, and this can be used as a bridge when traveling-plug in the battery to a wall charger and attach both devices to be charged. All three are getting juice this way.The battery charges with a micro slot and USB cord-about 6-8 inches long. I can use my iPhone wall charger to juice this up or the computer.The battery has a weak flashlight on it-not really needed, but I am sure someone will find it useful.Portable batteries have saved me more than once when I have misjudged my power left. This charger has a rubberized cover to protect it and is easily pocketable. And finally a portable charger than can be used with tablets.I highly recommend this."}

And thats when I realized: I am not the target consumer for this battery, she is.

But its very cleverly packaged for a woman who wants a battery with a sense of style!  Now, if only it had a matching blue iPhone case!!!For the techies: dont try and charge two devices with this battery at the same time, and at least for my iPhone, it seemed to work just fine when I plugged into the 2.1A slot, which made my phone think it was plugged into the wall and charge faster.

Never had a wireless pair until now.- With my lap top the sound is clear and I listen to a variety of genres. I intend to try using mySamsung Galaxy SIII, which I love, to play some tunes and see how that goes.- The charge holds well.

{"id": 151, "text": "This is my second set of wireless headphones and while theyre better than the first set I used, I would have to rate these headphones as okay.ComfortI found these to be extremely uncomfortable.  I have been unable to get a good fit even after trying all three sizes of earbuds.  Theyre hard and heavy and cause my ears to hurt almost immediately.Sound QualityOn a scale of 1-10, Id rate the sound quality about a 5.  This may be because I cant get a good fit in my ears, but even when I press them tightly in my ears and hold them there, the sound is kind of tinny.  Im not a connoisseur of headphones either.  My usual ones are Skull Candy, so nothing spectacular.  Im not saying the sound is bad, just not what Id expect from something in this price range.FunctionalityIm very pleased with how well these function.  They synched with my iPhone without any issues at all.  They work from a decent distance (I was able to sit my phone on the porch and mow the yard) and they dont cut out.  The cutting out was the major problem I had with my previous pair of wireless headphones.  The volume, power, song skip, etc. are easy to use as well.Battery LifeIm very please with the battery life as well.  Ive charged them and used them in the gym for an hour or so, tossed them in a bag and used them another hour or so in the evening, and forgotten to put them on the charger before the following day and never had a battery issue.Charging CableThe charging cable that comes with these is VERY short.  I would have liked one more than a few inches long.Charging CaseWhile this is a nice idea and its always great to have a backup, I cant get the headphones to fit in it and for it to close.  Maybe its not supposed to close???  I really dont feel like this adds a lot of functionality to the headphones overall unless youre one to constantly run out your battery.Overall, they work well, but the comfort issue is huge for me.  Theres no way I could stand these in my ears for longer than an hour."}
{"id": 152, "text": "This is a very compact set of bluetooth stereo headphones.  Basically you have two in-canal earphones attached by a flat cable between them.I have been using them for listening to podcasts and music and the sound is decent enough and better on the low end than many bluetooth headphones.Ive used multiple bluetooth stereo headphones over the years and this set has a lot of features I like.  The 3 button controls are very easy to use and to operate.  The problem with many such controls is that the individual controls are difficult to differentiate when operating them while wearing the headphones.  This is not the case here and I found I could quick pause/play, adjust volume, and go to the next track.I also really like how quickly they power up and pair - a problem with many bluetooth headsets.  A nice touch is that you get more than just power-up tones, but a synthesized voice describing the steps, power-up, paired, etc.  If you switch to another device it also tells you that.Since this set is quite small so there are two problems that occur.  One is that the range of these headphones is roughly a bit more than half of what a larger device would allow.  The other is that the battery time advertised of 4.5 hours is about what I got.A unique accessory is the charging case.  The case has its own battery so you can recharge the headphones when you are away from power.  At first I found this rather gimmicky, but it is not a bad idea especially considering the relatively short battery life because of their small size.Overall I am rather impressed with this stereo headset for what it offers in a minimal size."}

{"id": 156, "text": "Out of the box there was one thing I really liked about the M2 and M3 Bolse series was the fact that they had digital displays indicating the amount of charge left in the battery pack. I was pleased because this innovative design will allow the user to know exactly how much juice is left in the battery.  The LEDs are nice but as a rule, youll only see three or four of them and the range of charge can be wide.  Im used to working with these batteries and keep them charged up.  However, if you have one and only have 1 LED remaining, you may have a 1% charge or a 24% charge.  If you had a fuel gauge like that in a car, you might be driving on 1/4 of a tank or fumes.  Novel idea and I really liked it.I liked the promise of this battery, as well as the M2, until I started to test them.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I test every battery I get ... in real-time circumstances.  I use my iPad a lot and when its powered down sufficiently I start testing.  I figured a 6600mAh battery would be able to do a sufficient job powering up an iPad with a 46% charge remaining. The M3 struggled from the start with an immediate drop in charge from 97% down to 65% in fifteen minutes.  It was then I decided to watch and record very closely what was going on.A casual approach is usually my thing, but instead of a stellar performance Id expect from a 6600mAh battery pack, I only got an average one.  Bolse is usually a performer, but for some reason the M2 and M3 battery packs fell a bit short of my expectations.  The performance was OK, but nothing more.  If you want a Bolse, which is an excellent brand, Id look at the AON series, which really performed spectacularly.  Im rating this one a three, which is OK, on the Amazon scale.Bolse M3 (6600mAh) - 97% charged at startiPad - 46% charge at start15 minutes -  51%  (65%)30 minutes -  56%  (58%)45 minutes -  61%  (55%)60 minutes -  66%  (51%)75 minutes -  71 % (39%)90 minutes -  76%  (37%)120 minutes - 82% (19%)135 minutes - 85%  (LO)150 - The M3 stopped charging at this pointWHATS IN THE BOX:~ 1 Bolse M3 External Battery~ 3 connectors~ 1 Micro USB power cable~ 1 velvet-like travel pouch~ Quick start guideSPECS:~ Battery type: Li-ion battery~ Life cycle: ~500 cycles~ Input current:  800mAh~ Output current:Output USB1:  for iPad / iPhoneOutput USB2 for All Smartphones2A total max~ Capacity:  6600mAh~ Size: 4.13 x 2.36 x 0.71 inches~  Weight:  5.76 ounces~  Certifications:  CE & FCC & ROHSWarranty:  12 months limitedSample provided for review."}

{"id": 190, "text": "Got one of these for my wife, whos taking over this handset. It comes in nice colors (the reason she liked it) and is made of TPU (the reason I did). First she tried a colorful polycarbonate cover which came broken despite being pretty securely packed with 2-day shipping. Not a good sign. This cover is considerably more robust and- like most TPU covers- clearly affords good drop protection.The fit is very good, definitely a well-formed item that fits better than some other cheap covers Ive used (one a clear eForCity TPU, the other a generic silicone). It isnt as thin as Skinomis techskin- which I also tried- but it obviously affords better protection (that one was really just scratch protection). For a TPU cover, its pretty thin across the back which is fine on this handset- keeps the bulk down and the back is pretty well armored anyway. This was a problem I had with the previous clear TPU case, as it was so thick that it actually impeded the cameras. This one doesnt.Theres cutouts for the power button and 3-D selector, plus of course the cameras. headphone, USB, mic, and dock. Im a bit on the fence as to the cutout on the power button. The eForCity case had it covered, which took quite a bit of pressure to activate; this one doesnt have that problem but its quite hard to touch it in the first place since its a narrow cutout thats actually recessed beneath the TPU layer. If you have thick fingers, it can be quite a pain to do this (I do, my wife doesnt). Additionally, note the fact that the dedicated camera button is covered by this case. It still works, but it takes a lot more pressure. In some ways this can be good rather than bad, since I found I often activated the camera on accident before or when sticking the phone in a stand. However, if you frequently use this shutter button it can be a bit of a problem. The other ports and buttons work fine.Despite its snug fit, the case is very easy to remove. The eForCity case often took off the back panel along with it; this doesnt have that problem. It seems a good deal more flexible as well, and despite being thinner has the same nice rubberized grip. Overall its a decent case that looks nice and doesnt cost much."}

Wifi is set to only 25% and its still V fast if on the N setting 15Mb down and up. I have not rooted it yet, but I am sure once I do it will be faster.

{"id": 232, "text": "They are not anti reflective anti glare, you have plenty of glare cause this stuff makes it worst. An anti glare is sometimes considered Anti reflective but anti glare and anti reflective have two different meanings, Anti reflective means it allows all the light to pass though the film so all the light is projected through the screen making it brighter and clearer.  This thing has a matte finish which makes the light diverge causing less light to pass though the film so it makes the screen hard to see under normal out side light, yet you can see the screen in low light. The only anti glare film is polarized film, but that would not work in this application only anti reflective. Next time you hear anti glare tell em what is what, now you are the expert."}

I was linked to their application video that they sent in an e-mail to me that explained how to put it on without bubbles.  I followed the youtube video, took a hot shower, and then boom put it on without a single bubble.  Literally the only screen protector Ive ever put on a phone that had no bubbles at all.  The other plus was that these dont cover the entire front face of the phone they only cover the actual screen real estate so it fits perfectly and works with my Urban Assault Gear (UAG for those searching amazon reviews) case.  Ive been using it for a few days now and it really is reducing the amount of oil that appears on my screen.  I still wipe it off at the end of the day, but not every few times I swipe because I turned the screen off and see smudges.  I definitely recommend these matte screen protectors.  It does take away from some of the screen clarity, but the screen is still very bright, highly responsive, and stays very clean.  Excellent product, I highly recommend these protectors."}

This would have been the best holster I ever got if it allowed the phone to be placed both ways (facing in and out) BUT poor design. I am still happy as it does do a decent job protecting my phone when I dropped it a couple times as well as holster works, just not on an actual belt due to the clip being very thin. So for thick belts it might not stay on securely. I usually just clip it to my jean pocket (either inside the pocket for extra security or outside for convenience.)Overall, worth the $$$ but dont expect too much from it other than protection and a case with a kickstand.

But I had purchased one like this from someone else (LTZmart) and that one is perfect.  It came from Hong Kong but I didnt mind the wait since that one was good.  I would have gotten this one from them but they didnt have the hot pink.  Oh - and this one does have hairline cracks on the top.  Must be from the mold.  Not awful, but Im a perfectionist.

They come with tabs to use if there is any dust under the protector and those are very easy to use as well. I have purchased these as gifts and they have been very well received. You usually get what you pay for but these exceeded my expectations. They are very durable and they last a long time. They have only failed me because of user error.

There seem to be 2 types of cases on the market these days - cases that protect against minor bumps, and cases designed to protect against major drops. The Ringke SLIM case falls into the minor bumps category for sure. Having said that, it is the best case of its type. The Ringke case looks terrific - it almost looks like part of the phone. It adds almost no bulk or weight to your phone - feather light. And it feels great in your hands. I prefer the SF finish, which is slightly rubbery. But the LF finish is also great, but its more smooth (and slippery) than the SF finish. If you are always dropping your phone and cracking your screen, this is not the case for you. But, if you are looking to protect your phone from scratches and minor bumps, this is definitely the case for you."}

I use it to charge a Samsung Galaxy S3, and while Ive never gotten a dead-to-full charging time, its never let me down. Most importantly, it will keep the phone running with the GPS on, so you dont need to worry about running out of power on the road! One bit of caution: I left it plugged in for 3 days while I was gone on a trip, and when I got back, my car battery was completely dead. I never found any other battery-sucking device that was on in the car, so I think this (and the usb cord) drained a battery over 3 days! No problems since, and I try to always unplug it from the car before I leave it out overnight, but that was certainly curious."}

With two ports, one 2.1amp port and one 1ampport, I am able to charge my smart phone (Samsung Galaxy) and my iPad atthe same time! This saves time and space, two things of which I dont haveenough.I wish that there was some sort of indication as to which port is the2.1amp and which is not, so I do not have to plug the iPad in only to findthat it is not charging properly. Also I do not like how long the adapteris. It sits relatively far away from the wall, preventing furniture frombeing pushed close, especially when there is a usb cable plugged in.Aside from the length of the unit and the lack of labels, I really lovethis dual port usb adapter. It saves a lot of time and space by chargingtwo devices at the same time and only taking up one outlet. It feels solidwith the prongs folded in or out, and fits into the wall outlet snug enoughthat I have no fear that it will slide out. It is easily stored in a bagfor travel, and its smooth edges and corners prevent it from snagging.Overall I would give it a 5/5 and definitely recommend this product!"}
{"id": 314, "text": "The Dual Port AC Charger has two USB ports in one wall adapter so it frees up space. The wall adapter prongs fold away so it is protected during travel and is versatile. One does not have to worry about loosing his/her wall adapters because this charger replaces them so one just has to plug in his/her USB cables and charge. It saves room and time on trips because it is portable and one wall adapter. It is about the same size as many other wall adapters (not including the apple wall adapter) so it can be thrown in a bag or backpack easily or even in ones pocket for travel purposes. The charger works with most devices so one does not have to switch wall adapters to charge different devices. It works with tablets, phones, mp3 players, and more. I did not notice any decrease in charging capability as it was able to charge my iPad and phone at the same time and still charge them to full capacity around the same amount of time it takes to charge them to full capacity. The AC charger increases ones capacity to charge his/her devices so I would recommend this to anyone looking to free up space from wall outlets. It is a great addition to ones gear bag because this can be brought on vacations and if it is left on a vacation then one still has [for example] an apple and samsung wall adapter at home to spare. Also, the price will not break ones budget if it is lost or just for everyday use."}

{"id": 318, "text": "Im very pleased with the relatively small size/weight of this (vs other batteries with similar capacities), and the overall quality is quite good.Charging times for the battery itself are dependent upon what you charge it with (itll take forever to charge with a 500mA charger and, obviously, much less time with a 2A one), but its a 10000mAh battery, so of course itll take a while to charge. Once charged, it seems to be efficient in supplying that power to devices.The accessory pack provides most if not all plugs youd need, and the mesh bag is nice but should be just a wee bit longer - you can cinch it closed (mostly), but it isnt quite long enough. Still, it works and holds everything.Unlike similar items, this came with no discernible chemical smell - somethings, the items or cases make you almost gag until theyre aired out for days. Not the case with this one.Please keep in mind that no battery is 100% efficient while charging or being charged, so the 10000 mAh does not mean five 100% charges of a 2000mAh device battery. Youll lose some power on both ends, particularly on the device being charged,  which is why devices get warmer when charging/being charged. That said, this is at least as efficient as any similar battery I have."}
{"id": 319, "text": "After a three day power outage last winter with only a 5200mAh Anker to back me up, I decided to go big. I bought one of these and then a student stole it thinking it was a cell phone in its case.  I depended on it enough to buy a replacement.  This thing is a work horse and charges a cell phone or tablet with power to spare and does it quickly.  It comes with a series of common adapters for most devices and a carrying case.  The very best thing about Anker is the way they stand behind their products unconditionally.  As a family, we own 4 of their smaller cell batteries and when two of them did not perform up to expectations they immediately sent out replacements with return authorizations, so you keep the one you have until the new one arrives.  They offer an 18 month warranty and CS is very responsive, you really cant do better than that."}

It just happens that this version is all-around good and the very few negatives dont amount to a lot.So here it is why I like this model:&#10004; GOOD CAPACITY AND YET NOT HUGE OR HEAVY: at 5600mAh it can charge a phone two or three times. Once you fill it up with juice you can simply drop it in your bag and its ready to use when you need it.&#10004; COMES WITH ITS OWN CHARGER: most chargers on the market rely on you providing your own wall charger, which is not hard but, still, the one included is a welcome frill and it just happens to be smaller than most third party so Im glad its included.&#10004; INTERFACES GALORE: read Amazons description but, just in case you dont want to bother, the iFLASH comes with a modular system that has a USB Type-A at one end and it allows you to attach any of the supplied interfaces at the other end such as Mini USB, Micro USB, PSP (true), Nokia DC 2.0, iPhone/iPad (old style) and, of course, you can supply your own wire if none of these fit your device.&#10004; COMES WITH A BAG: this is very important to me. The nice blue bag can easily hold the iFLASH, the wall charger and the few wires and plugs you may need.&#10004; CHARGE INDICATOR RING LIGHTS: they light up when you press a button and 4 blue rings mean 100% full, 3 rings mean 75% full and so forth.&#10004; LITTLE LED FLASHLIGHT: just in case. Who knows, you may find yourself in complete darkness and this just might save the day.Output is 5V/1A which should make it good for charging phones, not good for charging tablets or anything bigger.The design isnt going to win any prize at an industrial design competition but even the looks are quite decent. If you are looking for a charger that works well and comes with everything you need, this one is very good choice. I didnt measure how many minutes it took this iFLASH to charge my phones but charged it did and it did it quickly and, once all I needed was in the bag already I didnt have to waste time looking for little wires or plugs.The negatives may or may not matter. If you have no idea how to use a an external battery to charge your phone you may not want this model. Unless you can read Chinese. The unit I received came with a Chinese-only user guide. The other issue is that fingerprints and various smudges are quite visible on the super-shiny, black finish. The two combined made this a four-star rating but this is still a great product as far as battery backups are concerned."}

Ive never ever had this issue with ANY of my other glass protectors ive used in the past nor did I have issues with the different brand glass protector im currently using.

I stumbled on the Lumsing because it was on sale, but as I looked at it carefully and read reviews, I became convinced I had to try it, even though I had never heard of the company. It is an incredibly powerful charger and ca charge 5 separate devices- and still have plenty of power left. I charge two devices on it regularly- which you should do even if your not traveling.It is incredibly fast. You will not believe how quickly your devices will reach a full charge on the Lumsing. My iPhone charges much faster on the Lumsing than it does using its regular cables. The unit communicates its level of juice with small LED lights, and Lumsing does not recommend recharging it until there is only 1 light left, which apparently would still provide charging to multiple devices for quite some time. The only issue I have with it, is that each of the 5 USB ports is slightly different, meant for different types of devices. The ports are clearly labelled with info like &#34;1A,&#34; which is iPhones I think. I still have to look then up in the materials that came with it, so this is really more my problem than Lumsings.  I guarantee that you will never be disappointed with Lumsing."}

I love that the volume and power buttons slightly stick out making them perfectly accessible and responsive. The cut outs are almost so precise, that youd think that it was the phone itself. The case feels nice in the hand but I wish it had a bit more grip. Could use just a little strip of rubber on the sides maybe or they could have slightly textured the sides just a bit. The ONLY things that I really hate (HATE) is that it is kind of an smudge/grease magnet and the case scuffs from just daily use. I found that I was constantly making sure there was nothing in my pockets to scuff it, also I was consciously making sure I placed it facing down instead of laying it on its back. I felt the nag of taking care of my nice case. I ended up buying a UAG case (also in slate blue) because it bugged me so much. I occasionally put this back on, but I wish so bad that it had the classy yet rugged feel of my Urban Armor Gear case. The UAG is basically smudge proof and very scratch resistant. If this had the same type of feel to the back as my UAG, itd be in my top ten favorite cases of all time. Ive  owned over 650 cases from the early iPhone /EVO days to now. Im a case nut. Before another company bought it out, I actually used to have my own website and sold cell phone cases for a living, so technically Ive had thousands of phone cases. Anyways for me to say that this would be one of my all time favorite cases if the back was a lot more scratch and smudge proof, is a big deal because (to make a simple understatement) Im very picky, almost obsessive, when it comes to phone cases.

{"id": 363, "text": "I really liked the design of the Jabra TAG bluetooth headset and the idea of wearing it like a dog tag however the more I wore this headset as a dog tag, I found myself getting aggravated with it because of how sensitive the front buttons are so I tried wearing the tag up high, right below the collarbone, to try and prevent accidental button pushes, makes the headphone wires hang out excessively around the neck and ear area. You can switch out the headphones with a pair of your own but then you lose the ability to wear the headset as a dog tag because the clip on the headphones that come with the Tag that makes this possible is not removeable.Overall, this is a good bluetooth headset but its design flaws are major ones in my opinion, especially if you were drawn to this device because of the dog tag style, that need to be corrected for it to be consider an excellent one, in addition to its asking price.Pros:- Voice commands when pairing, turning on/off and notification of low battery.- Easy pairing with my iPhone 5- Ear cushions are comfortable- Sound comes through clear and music plays with a good mid-level bass.- Shows Headphones battery level in the top right area of the iPhones display- The cord when rubbed against clothing etc. does NOT transmit static through the headphones- Phone calls are clear, no background echo.- The buttons are easy to access and all worked with the iPhone 5.- 3 front facing buttons:* Top Button, Multi-function: Make/Reject/Answer/Switch/Hold/Hangup Calls, Power On/Off, Pairing* Middle Button: Previous/Next Track or Scan for Radio Stations when in FM mode* Bottom Button: Turn FM Radio On/Off- Side Volume Buttons: Increase and Decrease- Voice notification of low battery starts when there is about 30 minutes of continuous play time left and repeats every 5 minutes until out of power then powers off automatically.- Supports controlling music and getting gps information from your bluetooth enabled device.- Uses Bluetooth 3.0- Will support other bluetooth devices that are compliant with bluetooth version 1.1 or higher- Can be used with other headphones- Can be worn lanyard style or clipped to clothing- A charger with a 12 inch cord is included but the TAG can be charged with any microUSB 5.0 volt charger.- Comes with three sets of ear cushions: 1 large, 1 medium and 1 smallNeutral:- I had to re-pair the Jabra TAG with my iPhone 5 (Delete pairing, turn off iPhone to reset its bluetooth pairings, turn it back on then pair again) because the TAGs volume buttons would not work with my iPhone the first time I paired it.- Isnt noise cancelling.- 2 hour charge timeCons:- The placement of the main buttons on the front of the TAG plus how easy they are to push causes accidental Play/Pause, FM Radio On/Off, Calling the last number dialed and Previous/Next track incidents that can be very aggravating. All of these accidental button pushes have happened to me. I found in order to minimize this problem I have to either position the TAG high around the neck (which cause too much excess wires around the ears from the bunching) so it doesnt swing forward and hit something while move or leaning forward, or clipped to your clothing. Doing either of these doesnt insure 100% protection against accidental button pushes because the buttons are very sensitive and easy to push.- The headphone cord is too long for me which maybe because Im a small person, 52. When I wear the headphones lanyard style I end up with too much slack in the line around my ears unless I adjust the device to sit mid-stomach which I dont prefer since this causes the accidental button pushes.- Cant remove the clip that turns the headphone cord into a lanyard style to use with other headphones.- Cant be used while charging.- FM Radio antenna is weak so I could only pick up 3-4 radio stations, depending on how much static interference.- Cant save radio stations as presets."}

{"id": 365, "text": "Over the past few years Ive become a bit of an expert on Bluetooth wireless headsets. They seem an almost ideal way of listening to music or making the phone calls. The Bluetooth headsets are ideal for workouts: compact, unobtrusive, and very functional. I have gone through at least five MOTOROKR S9 and MotoROKR S9-HD headsets all of which shared one common major shortcoming: they were not sweat-proof and inevitably stopped working after less than a year of use. I also own four different Jabra Bluetooth headsets, and have become fairly familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of various models.In terms of functionality, my favorite Bluetooth headsets are still the stereo sport variety kinds. They are extremely compact and ideally suited for what I primarily use headphones for these days: listening to music while working out. However, most of them have (at least) two major shortcomings: lousy music quality and inability to withstand sweat over the prolonged use. This is why I have recently decided to give the &#34;pendant&#34; Bluetooth stereo headsets a try. So far I have been fairly impressed with this Jabra Play headset, albeit there are still a couple of shortcomings that I dont like.First of all, I am really impressed with the sound quality. Its not even remotely hissy or tinny like many other headsets that I had tried. If you are a die-hard audiophile then you will still find many shortcomings of these headphones, but for someone like me who just enjoys fairly clear and strong sound these headphones do the job.Pairing of these headphones was pretty straightforward, although you need to follow the instructions exactly - its not enough for the headphones to be turned on in order for them to become &#34;discoverable.&#34;When I first started using these headphones it seemed that they would get completely discharged the first time I turned them off and tried using them again. This has happened a couple of times, but it must be a glitch since it has not happened to me again. Ive been able to use them four to five times for a workout without recharging them, which is definitely much better battery life than most other headphones Ive tried.The range of this headset seems to be on par with all other similar devices. I was able to listen to my iPhone across a larger room (gym) even with some obstacles in the way.My biggest issue with these headphones is their design. I dont like having the headphones receiver dangling in front of me, especially when I am working out. Ive tried clipping it both to my t-shirts sleeve and collar, but neither one of these locations is very conducive to working out either. Finally, I attached the receiver to my t-shirt behind my neck. This gets the job done, but its also a very inaccessible location. I dont mind this all that much though, but the headphone cords tend to get tangled up very easily. This might be the most entangable cords Ive come across.I have not used this headset for telephony. Overall I have not been impressed with Bluetooth headsets as phone receivers - they tend to be extremely choppy as receivers and I am still to come across a model for which this is not an issue. For phone calls I try to use the corded headsets as much as possible.This is a pretty good Bluetooth headset that is ideal for music listening in a wide variety of locations and situations."}

{"id": 367, "text": "My previous phone was the GSM Galaxy Nexus, I used it for about a year. My main complaints about the Galaxy Nexus (GNex) was the lack of 3G, limited internal memory and the terrible speakers. I got an opportunity to upgrade my phone and after exhaustive research I picked the One.Things I like about the phone:1. Boomsound speakers. Gimmicky name but they are really good, much better than any Galaxy phone. I use the speakerphone whenever I can instead of holding the phone up to my ear, and I dont like using bluetooth. They are loud enough that I cant use them at max volume. Music sounds great but the volume is limited by the quality of music you listen to.2. Build quality. To each his own. I just dont like plastic on my phones, some people do. it feels really good in the hend.3. Battery: So far the longest I have got out of this phone is 24 hours plus. I will admit I am not a power user. I use wifi whenever I can. I put the screen on automatic or lowest brightness. I dont play games even though this will run anything you throw at it. All email is set to not sync, Facebook does auto sync though. And I use an app called Juice Defender in the Play store.Things I dont like.1. Sense: I will agree that it is better than Samsungs TouchWiz skin though. The dialer is straight up fugly. And if you dont like Blinkfeed please get Nova Launcher in the Play store, it will banish blinkfeed from.2. I wish the power button was on the side. I have used Samsungs for 2 generations already and I am used to the buttons being on the sides."}

The case is four pieces with the holster, so you have to be in a spot where you can do it and not drop the pieces of the case.  But well worth the trouble of taking it apart and putting it back together.  The only problem I had was I had to return the first one because the clip on the holster when I knocked into the wall.  the second one has been fine.  Oh, and there were some comments about the phone not locking into the holster securely, as well it not locking in with the screen facing outward, which is necessary if you want to use the stand feature of the holster.  I have NO problem doing either of these.  Simple trick is to be careful, listen for the click of it locking in and give it a tug to make sure.  Good case."}

{"id": 374, "text": "I sent the item back because when I installed it, it had bubbles under the screen. I contacted tech armor and they sent me a replacment but they sent me a cheap screen protector that wasnt even made of glass, its one of the 30 cent ones you can buy on amazon. When I contacted the customer service they didnt respond I have sent over 4 emails to the customer service and after the 5th email I got a response saying I am sorry we can not help you.  The the glass screen protector scratches fairly easy too. I had it one for 2 days and there were scratches all over it and I never keep anything else in my pocket with my phone I bough the Zagg Invisishield HD(there is a difference HD is much more clearer) and they warranty exchange your product for the life of your device. I have already gotten 2 replacements and they are always more than willing to help. That is why i will always choose ZAGG as the best screen protectors because you get a quality product and the BEST WARRANTY of any screen protector.  Ill never buy another tech armor product again and I will never recommend them to anyone.  If you do buy this item if you dont install it right the first time or if dust gets under the screen your S.O.L. because the tech armor customer service are a joke.UPDATEI contacted tech armor and this time spoke to another person and he sent me a new product.  I installed it and it worked great for about 2 weeks. It actually looks awesome if you install it correctly because it feels like glass and is sorta scratch resistant. I always keep it in my pocket by itself never with anything else in there and never dropped it but somehow scratches showed up. I had my phone in between my legs as i was driving and had a metal business card holder on my leg and the little metal business card holder slid off my leg and hit the corner of the screen protector which caused a tiny tiny chip in the glass screen protector.  Then i dropped my phone from about 3 feet onto hardwood and the screen protector cracked all over. So i went back to my ZAGG invishield HD screen protector because they give you unlimited exchanges.  What really  burns me most about this product is that if you get dust under the item on installation or install it crooked its done for because you can only apply it once.  Even if you install it in a bathroom with the hot shower going and its really foggy dust still shows up its not full proof."}

It was an easy setup - not unlike any other bluetooth set. It told me that I had 2 hours of talk-time. I was not happy and finally understood the Amazon description above - Power2go portable charger enables you to charge on the go, allowing a total of 10 hours of talk time -2 hours in headset alone. I called a friend to test the call quality and the communication was clear. After having spoken for 10 mins, I checked the battery status and the voice guidance told me that I had 1 hr 30 minutes of talk time remaining. A headset which cannot provide even have 2 hours of talk time is a deal-breaker!I put the headset back into the pebble charger - the only way to recharge. I had 1 hour of talk time after 25 minutes and about 2 hrs after about an hour of charging.Definitely a DO NOT BUY recommendation!PROS:* Great concept of providing a compact, well designed on-the-go charger* Very light and comfortable fit with choice of eargels to customize fit.* Good call quality* Voice guidance worksCONS:* Short talk time - Approx 2 hours* Long recharge cycle - Approx. 1 hour for a full charge* Short recharge cordGreat concept but poorly executed!"}
{"id": 384, "text": "Although lightweight, the construction is very solid and highly durable. Beside the front and the top metal speaker grills, the edges and the sides are encapsulated in a quality rubberized material. The back is hard plastic with a tightly fitting rubber flip/gasket to seal micro-usb charging port and 3.5mm aux input. Also on the back you find a rotating loop to clip the included carabiner. The bottom has a universal mounting tripod thread that comes very handy to mount EcoRox either on tripod or any other accessory such as suction cup or bicycle handlebar. Underneath of the front grill you have 2 front firing speakers, each rated at 3W RMS for a total of 6W. The top grill covers a passive bass speaker/port. On the front top edge you also get 3 led indicators for power on, bluetooth connection, and battery status (charging status as well as an alarm when you are down to about 30min of battery charge). Speaking of charging, this little guy houses a whooping 1400 mAh battery that will enable playtime of over 10hr from full charge!!!What I totally didnt expect was a full set of dedicated controls without any double functionality. You have a dedicated power button with led indicator, bluetooth pairing button also with led indicator when its paired up, a separate volume up/down control, a separate skip next/prev control, and play/pause button which also picks up a call. There is also a microphone at the front bottom of the speaker. EcoRox did a decent job as a speakerphone and seamlessly switched between playing music and picking up calls. The caller on the other end didnt have any complains about sound quality or background noise. Next was the music playback test. I do realize these are small light drivers so there is no high expectations. 6W of power is pretty good for a high volume, but unfortunately at higher volume sound was somewhat distorted especially in low frequency range, and high frequency content wasnt as clear as I expected. I wasnt surprised with a results since these are no audiophile speakers. Another thing I noticed was a slightly limited bluetooth range in comparison to other speakers that can play easily at 30+ ft away from the phone, while EcoRox started to get choppy reception at half of that range when I was holding it by its sides. In clear sight or on a tripod it was fine, only while holding it. In general that was also expected because of a rugged shell probably interfering with the signal sensitivity and my hands blocking it even further.Now, here comes the best part of the review - water dunking!!! This speaker is rated at full IPX7 & IPX8. You can submerge it under the water without causing a permanent damage!!! I had the power on, dunk the speaker under the water, took it out and it was playing wetordry without any problem. One thing to note, when you drop the speaker into the water it floats with bass port up and speaker port submerged into a water where you cant really hear the sound well. Its great to know if you are around the pool and drop EcoRox or outside in the rain or someone hoses it with a water - your speaker will be safe. But if you are planning to have this speaker floating in the pool and playing music at the same time you better off trying EcoXBT which is designed to float with a speaker facing up.Overall I think its a great rugged portable speaker, perfect for outdoors, by the pool or on the beach, mounted on a bike or with a suction cup in the shower, on a tripod mount or by itself or clipped to your backpack. Its not for audiophiles, but the sound quality is not that bad considering the size of the speaker/driver, and its a huge bonus to have full dedicated playback/volume controls and speakerphone functionality."}

I really wasnt worried about NFC (while nifty, it doesnt really have a useful purpose for me), but I tested it anyway.  It NFCed to my Nexus 7 FHD without a hitch.Charging speed is slightly slower then USB, but it saves the hassle of finding (and keeping) a USB cable that fits well with the S4.

I was hoping it would just be a simple micro or mini usb on the charger, but no big deal. You can still lengthen the cord with a usb extention cord, if needed. Overall, simple and works.

{"id": 390, "text": "Review of Arcadia ArcPak 7.4 - ACD740 - 7400mAh Dual USB Ports External Battery Charger/ Portable Back Up Power BankI am a big believer of external battery chargers for mobile devices, particularly when traveling.  I have owned several from 1500 mah to 4000, 8000, 10400, and even larger capacity.  This ArcPak is one of the best I have tried for several reasons.1.  It charges with a standard micro USB port.  A cable is included for charging from PC or USB charger and can also be used to then charge a device with micro USB charging port.2.  It is a small package for the capacity it provides.  It is smaller than a 4000 mah battery I own and less than half the size of an 8000 battery.  That is a huge difference in size and weight, making it great for travel.  BTW, both the 4000 and 8000 packs have proprietary, or at least uncommon, charge ports.  When I purchased them this was not a big deal because it seemed like most such external packs used some sort of port that was not a standard, easily obtainable, USB variation.  Since I travel with several micro USB cables for my devices, it is a comfort to know I do not have to remember to pack a special cable to charge the battery pack.3.  Two USB ports allow charging of two devices at the same time.4.  The ArcPak 7.4 can be used as a charger adapter.  In other words you can plug devices in while the battery is charging, and it will pass through power to charge the devices.  When the devices are charged the ArcPak 7.4 will finish charging itself.I tend to &#34;pressure test&#34; chargers and battery packs to see if they live up to their specs and what I can count on.  Too many chargers and battery packs tend to fall short and disappoint.  I am happy to report that this ArcPak 7.4 performs even better than I expected.  Here are some real life results.1.  When I received the ArcPak 7.4 and plugged in the charger, it displayed two of the four charge indicator LEDs.  In almost exactly 4 hours it was showing full charge, all 4 LEDs lit.  The specs say 8 hours to charge so this is right on the money.2.  I plugged in my Samsung Galaxy Note, which requires 1A to charge.  It started at 61% and was at 100% in one hour, forty-five minutes.3.  The maximum output of the ArcPak 7.4 is stated as a TOTAL of 2.1A. I plugged in an iPad 2 and my Galaxy Note at the same time.  The iPad requres 2.0-2.1A to charge, and the Note requires 1A.  Even though the two together should theoretically require 3.1A to charge, BOTH charged.  I observed to assure that battery charge % on both devices increased.4.  Now here is the most amazing test result to me.  Keep in mind that the stated maximum total is 2.1A.  I plugged in BOTH the iPad 2 (requires 2.0-2.1A) AND a new Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 which requires 2.0A to charge.  BOTH began charging quite nicely.  In about 10 minutes the iPad had increased from 71% to 74% and the Tab 3 from 79% to 81%.  Both devices were powered on with wifi on (as well as 3G on the iPad).  At best I hoped to see them hold steady.  For both to be increasing in battery charge, and so quickly, was totally unexpected.  I plugged them in at about 11 PM.  At 5 AM both tablets were displaying 100% charge, and the 1 of the 4 charge indicator LEDs still displayed.  At the rate they were charging I would estimate that it probably took 1 to 2 hours for the devices to charge completely, then both continued to run on the ArcPak 7.4s power the rest of the time.  I would be very interested to let both tablets get down to about 10% then see what the ArcPak 7.4 can do.  On a very long plane flight recently my wifes iPad went through both of the 4000 mah batteries I had taken.  The little ArcPak 7.4 no doubt would have done the job just as well.  I may still get another, though, because I believe in having backups for my backups!I am not exaggerating when I say the ArcPak 7.4 has exceeded my expectations!  I will probably be giving away my other external batteries.  No need to keep them since I see no reason to use anything other than the ArcPak 7.4!  If you need a small supplemental external battery pack the ArcPak 7.4 should serve well.  It has amazing capacity built into an amazingly small package, and it works even better than the already impressive specs would suggest!"}
{"id": 391, "text": "I bought this device in anticipation of an upcoming loooooong roadtrip knowing wed have multiple people in the car.  I already have a couple of backup batteries but wanted something extra thatd be worth keeping after the trip.The device is mostly covered in a soft but slightly slick black plastic with a grey textured plastic grip section.  This gives it a premium feel in the hand.  The overall size is about that of a deck of cards so this can easily slip into a purse or pocket for travel.It takes about 8 hours to charge to full time but this is standard in the battery market.  With that youll get 7400mAh of battery - enough to charge a phone from dead to full 2 times with some to spare possibly (depends on your phone - personally I was able to almost get a third charge out of it).  Charging my phone took about 3 hours, so I was impressed.  Theres 4 blue LEDs to indicate approximate percentage of life remaining.Pros:++ Nice fit/finish++ Charges devices fast+ 2.1A output+ PriceCons:- Larger battery w/ 1A input results in slow charge timeOnly thing Id really change is that Id like to see a larger input option to cut down on charging time.  Overall its a good battery at a good price.  I really like the texture and feel to it and its one of the nicer to hold batteries Ive used."}
{"id": 392, "text": "This is a nice, small, relatively light, powerful portable Bluetooth and cabled speaker.Audiophiles probably wouldnt like it: the frequency range is narrow, clustered around the middle tending toward a muddy bass. It is okay for music, but certainly not great. However, if youre using it in a moderately to fairly loud environment, you wont notice or care.Volume is apartment filling loud. No one will call the police, but I could hear the speakers reasonably well 50 feet away. By the way, the volume can be controlled from your device or on the speakers.Setup could not be simpler. Hold down two buttons to imitate Bluetooth search and engage it on your device. The range of the Bluetooth device I tested it with was not impressive - about 15 feet. I dont know if that was the fault of the transmitting device, the speakers or something else.As a thoughtful touch, a simple means of clearing the stored Bluetooth  pairing is provided, which should save some people from grief.You can also use a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable for hooking up to non-Bluetooth devices.There is a USB port for charging cell phones.A reasonably small AC adapter is provided. The manufacturer says to expect 8 hours from a fully charged battery. I didnt run it that long.A cloth carrying sack is also provided.Overall, this is one of the best portable Bluetooth speakers Ive tried. Its loud, even if not audiophile quality; its fairly small and light. And it is very easy to use. Handy at home of course, but flexible enough to take with you to the beach or even through in a checked suitcase.Jerry"}

Needing to recharge at an outlet in a locker area just to get through a day, with just basic use.  After receiving this, I spent two days at Disneyland, and it changed the nature of the trip.  Able to take pictures and videos of my kids without worrying about power.  Staying in touch with my husband while he was at a conference.  Checking wait times online.  Posting pics to facebook for the grandparents.Then this past week, I used it for 5 days on vacation in New York.  Mapping, TKTS booth, theater info, yelp, subway schedules, attraction info, messaging the kids, photos galore.. constant use.  And it lasted confidently all day. I am so glad that I have this for travel, I cant even express.The case is sleek and very comfortable in the hand.  Yes, it is taller and thicker than my regular mercury case but surprisingly not irritatingly so.  It sleeps easily into pockets but doesnt slide around.  I was able to plug the regular iphone headphones without using the adapter included with the case.All that said, I will not use it all the time.  On days when I am back and forth in the car it is easy to plug it in while I go, and keep a charge.  And at home, I like to use the phone with audio docks and dock chargers which I cant do with the charger case, which uses a more standard mini-USB (or micro.. I cant ever keep that straight... the most common one).For people who are out and about all day without car or USB access to charge power-hungry iphones, I can not recommend this highly enough."}

It fits well in the hand and sits flat andsturdy. Though comfortable in the hand, it is not as comfortable in thepocket because of the stiffness and size required to make it shockproof.This device also packs a bit of weight, 289g (~10.2oz) which is not bad atall considering its weather proofing and huge capacity. The port coverseems very well designed. It has a secure hinge and clicks satisfyinglyinto place when you close it, allowing you to be sure that it is in factsealed. This device advertises a charging time of approximately 10 hours,however I have found that mine charges to full between 9 and 9.5 hours.After attaching the velcro strap and the carabiner to the unit, I am ableto attach it to almost anything. I have secured it in my car, on mybackpack, to a branch outside, and even to my bicycle to keep my phonecharged during long rides when GPS was necessary.I think it is pretty clear that I do really like this product, but it isnot perfect.

The device seems toturn itself off when it is not in use which can be convenient, but beingthe control freak I am, a way to be sure that the device is off withouthaving to plug something in would be nice.Another problem I have found is with the usb port cover. On the outside ofthe cover, there is an etching that tells the user which port is the 1ampport and which port is the 2.1amp port. After opening the cover however,there are no indicators differentiating the two ports, which made me closeand reopen the cover to make sure. I feel that this is an easily fixableproblem with an etching under the lid, but after a day or two of use I gotused to it.I can be a very nit-picky person when it comes to aesthetics, and I thinkthat this device looks great. There is however an issue that bothered me,but did not seem to bother anyone else that I showed it to. When I holdthe device face-up (indicator lights and port cover facing me, etchingsupright and readable), and open the cover, my usb cords do not fit in theports face-up (usb symbol on the cord showing on top), but instead have tobe flipped upside-down (usb symbol on the cord facing down, out of sight).This probably does not matter for most people, but I feel that the usbports should be inverted.Despite those minute issues I have encountered, I really do love thisdevice. I feel that it would be perfect for anyone from the hectic student,to the hardcore backpacker. With its rugged water, dirt, and shockproofexterior, huge battery capability, and ability to quickly charge two thingsat once, this is a battery I will always keep nearby. I would definitelyrecommend this product.Warning! There is one thing I do not understand. When I bought thisproduct online, it was advertised to be water &#34;resistant&#34;. When I receivedthe box, the box said it was water &#34;proof&#34;. When I read the back of theuser manual, it said under Safety & Maintenance &#34;Do not expose battery packto water or humidity&#34;. It looks and feels waterproof, but I am not surewhat to believe.Overall Rating - 4/5Breakdown:Appearance - 5/5Convenience - 5/5Usability - 4/5Instruction manual - 2/5"}
{"id": 401, "text": "The powerpak xtreme is disaster- proof. It has two different am USB ports that can charge a tablet as well as a smart phone at the same time and still have plenty of juice left over for another round of charging or two (depending on which devices one charges). The powerpak has a 12,000 mAh capacity battery, which is plenty to spare when taking it on vacation. The large capacity of the battery pack does add some weight to the powerpak. The powerpak has amazing build quality. It seems like the powerpak can be taken just about anywhere and it would come out still working and in decent condition. The LED battery indicator (blue) is useful for checking how much charge is left in the portable battery, although it may need to be pressed more than once for a response. The powerpak charges fairly quickly for a portable battery, but keep in mind that when charging a tablet an a phone, one must use the correct USB port as one has 1A and the other has 2.1A. It does come with a micro USB to USB cable to charge the device, but a wall adapter is not included. One must supply his/her own USB cables for charging with the powerpak, which is the case with most portable battery packs. This is a massive upgrade from my 5200 mAh battery pack, which charged my phone up to two times, while the 12,000 mAh powerpak boosts charging of about 5- 6 times full charges for my phone. The powerpak is a definite necessity for traveling on trips with limited access to electricity to charge devices. The included carabiner is a plus as it allows one to attach the powerpak to the exterior of a bag for easy access to it when needed. This battery pack is great for camping, hiking, and many other activities. I would recommend the powerpak to those looking for a elements- proof portable battery pack with a large capacity but still small enough that it is travel- friendly."}
{"id": 402, "text": "First impressions:  My initial thought when opening the NT120R was Woo...nice!  To be honest, I expected something that I might get from DealExtreme or Meritline, but was woefully wrong.  This item is like science fiction art.  Clean lines, smooth mold edges, and a solid feel (doesnt bend when I squeeze it) gives credibility to this item.General Use:  This is such a life saver.  I have a smart phone, my son has a smart phone and my wife has a tablet.  Were always fighting over the chargers, especially on the road.  This solved so many of those problems.  We tried charging devices using both USB ports on the NT120R and everything charged fine.Size:  This is a rad brick.  It holds a LOT of charge and because of that, its quite large.  Not overly large...pleasantly large.  I can still carry it around in my man-bag with ease.Capacity:  This is not an emergency charger.  Those are designed to bring you from 5% to 15% until you can find an outlet...  this is a full-fledged outlet in your pocket.  We were brainstorming uses for this and came up with so many.  The most important to my family was To use at Disneyland.  We like to look up historical ride and park info, submit line-wait times, play games while in line or gps map our walk around Disneyland parks on the 1 or 2 times per year that we go there.  However, this requires so much more battery power than our phones can store.  The NT120R will solve that problem for us.  We could easily keep the batteries charged using the NT120R while in line, or while we walked.  No more worrying about losing fun GPS data, or not being able to look up what the Matterhorn used to look like before they book the sky-ride out!Powering/Charging of phones/ipod/tablet:  Very impressive.  I was able to charge 2 different android phones and a nexus tablet to full capacity with this unit.  This is not a comment regarding the capacity of the unit, but the ability to charge phones fully.  I have a few other external battery devices (solar, or usb charge) and the best they can do it get my battery to about 80%.  Plugging my devices into the NT120R seemed just as good as plugging them into the wall.  Excellent!  Finally, this is an external / remote battery source I can count on.  I used this unit to charge my devices for about a week until it finally ran out of battery.Wish List:  I have two suggestions as to the physical design1)  Add a phone stand/easel.I found myself using this in two fairly distinct situations.  First, when I wanted my phone to simply charge while I was away from home/car.  In this case the phone was in my backpack or bag plugged in and charging.  I was not otherwise interacting with the phone.  Second, when I wanted to use my phone while it was charging, but couldnt plug it in to the wall.  For example, Im watching a movie with my wife on my phone, and its low on battery.  In this case, I often found myself setting the NT120R down, and leaning my phone against it.  The phone would slide down and Id either hold it, or fetch a prop to hold it up.  Many times I wished the NT120R had a built-in stand for a phone to lean against.  I picture something similar to the door that opens to reveal the charging ports... but on the top or bottom side of the unit (as if it was laying down like a book.)  Something you flip up, and that acts as an easel for my phone.  If youre interested, let me know and I could draw a sketch of what I mean, and email it to you.  This is a feature Id really use, but only in the nice to have category.2)  Connection indicator.  While charging the NT120R, the 4 LED lights work great to show that the unit is charging.  However, while plugging it into a phone/tablet/ipod to charge, it would be nice to know it was indeed charging...or at least if it was connected.  Id plug my ipod into the NT120R and it would begin charging, but would soon stop for some reason.  The only way to know this is to look at my ipod and notice it wasnt charging.  Same with my phone... The phone would stop charging, and the NT120R would turn off.  It would be really nice to look at the NT120R and see that an LED has gone out, indicating that no charging is taking place.  Still only a nice to have as you get to know how your devices charge.  When you plug them in, you know whats happening, and dont really need to see the light etc.Summary:  If youre not looking for a tiny hide-in-your-shirt-pocket charger, this is the one.  Its well made, charges like a boss, and can be drop kicked across the road with no adverse affects.  Get it."}

{"id": 404, "text": "On your keyring, of course :)Now, if you lose your keys, which I do from time to time, then maybe you should keep a normal wire somewhere and remember where you stored it.Anyways, this is a perfectly capable little wire that, once attached to your keyring, should be always available when you need it, wherever you happened to be. At 3, its about the length of an average car key. Worked well for me and I shouldnt worry about this particular wire for as long as I remember to reattach it once Im done syncing and charging.Five stars for the convenience.Full disclosure: I received a for review wire but I did not promise an enthusiastic review in return. It just came out this way."}

I would only stop in to check it out in person. Then... it just happened. If youre like me and coming from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus, Im betting this latest batch from Motorola caught your eye, too. I fully intended to wait for the first reviews, maybe check out the oversized Note III and HTC One Max, and see what LG was bringing to the table, but.../// The Maxxs oversized battery is only part of the attraction. My Nexus had become fickle -- I weeded out a few apps that were absolute battery hogs on that device. While I didnt expect the full two day battery life promised by Verizon, the Maxx had to be at least 2x better than the Gnex, based alone on double battery capacity. But better! After my first 100% charge, I ended my day at 7% after 16 hours off the charger, heavy first day with a new phone usage, 1.5 hours video, 1+ hours audio streaming, 45 minutes unplugged Nav, forum browsing & posting, futzing with apps, editing this review, Bluetooth headset use, switching between wifi and 4G about 50/50, lots of screen on time, etc. Ive since repeated this with up to 23 hour days, 5-8 hours screen time, video & nav, completely off the charger. Ive bumped my screen timeout to 5 minutes, and dont bother switching off WiFi or GPS. And if thats not epic enough (for me, it is), theres a Battery Saver slider on the settings menu -- I havent bothered to flick that On to see what it affects. [edit 7/14 Bbattery life is much reduced; I get about a full day without plugging in, and routinely charge it when using Waze or Nav. To be fair to the phone, Id have to nuke all apps and restore to like new condition to evaluate, because I have lots of tasks on in the background. And naturally, batteries lose capacity with use, and as they are subjected to never ending charge/discharge cycles.]Amazingly, the extra battery doesnt come at the expense of size. Held back to back, side to side, end to end, these two phones are close to identical in size. You can get the numbers from the spec sheet, but the Maxx is about 3-4 millimeters taller and wider than the Gnex, and more or less identical in thickness. According to my straight edge, the Maxxs screen even has a slight curve to it, ala the overly-hyped curved glass of the Galaxy Nexus.But its definitely shaped differently. I ran my Gnex without a case for the past year, and Im starting out caseless with the Maxx. I dont see it visually, but the Maxx has a wedge feel to it, where the top end of the phone is thicker, and it slims down towards the bottom. The top end is also heavier. What this means is that, when Im holding it in one hand, most of that weight is concentrated on my index finger. Id prefer it the other way around -- with that weight and thickness at the bottom -- where its resting more on two fingers. I know, I know... were only talking about 164g according to my scale, but the phone feels more comfortable and balanced when I hold it flipped around like that. Despite the very similar size to my old phone, the Maxx has a definite chunky feel to it, not UNcomfortable, but -less- comfortable than my previous phone.+++ My wife slipped a Diztronic TPU case onto her Maxx, and despite its slim dimensions, the phone feels bulky and unpocketable. My recommendation is to skip the case if you can.+++ If you need a quality holster for this phone and want to run caseless, and dont mind an easy do-it-yourself mod, check my review for this Sedio spring clip unit:Seidio HLSSG4AASAThe phones back is interesting. Its not the shiny, hard plasticky finish of the Droid Ultra. Instead, its a very lightly textured (rubberized) but smooth finish, with the appearance of a fiber weave. This finish wraps around the bottom edges of the phone and even around the chin to the face, down by the mic. The bottom corners are all rounded, so theyre somewhat comfortable -- not squared off, though not as rounded as the Galaxy Nexus. The back is smooth enough that it -does- gets smudged with fingerprints, but matte enough that theyre not easily noticeable. The Verizon and Droid labels are modestly sized, and rather than bright white, are of a dark gray hue that is easy to ignore.All together it creates a package with a hefty, high-quality feel. I never minded the durable all-plastic construction of my Nexus and Samsungs Galaxy lineup -- something many reviewers and forum posters dismiss as cheap. But the Maxx feels anything but, possibly belied by its flat slab appearance.Interrupting the smooth Kevlar wrap are the power and volume buttons -- all stacked on the right side -- that project from the device perhaps a little more than necessary, and with very square edges and textured surfaces. The buttons dont really jive with the carefully crafted, smooth-to-the-touch backside finish, but then again, theres no mistaking when my fingers are resting on them -- even lightly -- so hopefully no accidental presses./// Boot is about 1 minute 15 seconds to home screen/slide-to-unlock, but 2:25 until I get a PIN pad unlock (time in between, apps still loading and processes running) [post KitKat 4.4.4 update; original boot time was 30 seconds, which increased to 45 seconds with 12.15.15, then 55s w/ 4.4]. Thats still pretty quick to phones Ive owned previously, but nearly double the stock, Day 1 boot time. The busy (and noisy) Droid boot animation, followed by the default red home screen, put me off at first -- it all just feels very angry -- but as Im sure youre aware, thats all easily changeable with a good selection of included live and static wallpapers (a soothing blue relaxed the feel of the phone for me; I wonder if the default aggressive red tone -- VZWs Droid branding -- turns off would be buyers at the in-store display).While looking for my next phone, Ive been really intrigued by the front-firing speaker on the HTC One. My previous phone (like practically every other phone) was rear-firing, but with speaker placement at the bottom of the phone, where my hand tended to cup it and muffle the volume. Not to mention it was a pretty weak speaker. The Maxx? Surprisingly good, by comparison. The speaker is at the top of the phone, co-located with the camera. Its loud. Even when facing into my passenger seat, the Google Nav directions come through crisply. Ive tried to muffle the sound with my hand, like for instance when holding the phone in landscape mode to watch a video, and it comes through loud and clear. The sound is still projecting to the rear, which means the phone is projecting away from me and toward the rest of the room that Im facing, but its so much improved over the Gnex that Im now only partially envious of the HTC speaker.I recall quite a bit of forum debate over the 3.5mm audio jack placement on the Nexus -- some folks absolutely HATE the bottom placement (I, for one, was a fan). The Maxx puts that jack up on the top of the phone, where many users think is its rightful place. I suppose Im indifferent since I tend to use bluetooth headphones when Im out. But at home, laying in bed and catching up on some YouTube while plugged in to my charger, Ive now got to contend with cords coming out of both sides of my phone.One other design niggle -- wnen using the phone on a flat surface, screen presses anywhere within a half inch of the edges causes the phone to rock. The back runs flat for a few inches from top to bottom (down the spine), but is curved side to side all the way across.Lets talk about the Super AMOLED (RGB) screen. The quality is great. Really, Im dont feel deprived without 1080p. But, dont hate me for this, I preferred some aspects of the Galaxy Nexus Pentile (non-RGB) AMOLED better. Heres what Im noticing with the Maxx:- whites look slightly gray, particularly in a dark room- blacks have sort of a reddish tinge to them, particularly in dark- in general, pictures look underexposed (for instance when browsing a news website)- in video playback, the black and darker areas of the screen have better overall consistency than on my Gnex (less noise)- in bright sunlight, the screen brightness cant meet the challenge (so whats new?)- but in dark rooms, its almost as though the screen cant dim enough (but just slightly so)- the active notifications appearing on the screen arent ever-present -- the phone needs to be jostled / disturbed for the blank screen to briefly light up and display the current notifications, BUT the phone does not need to be flipped over to activate this (a light tapping of the face-up phone causes the Active Display to light up)- >> the capacitive buttons now dim during most video playback [as up 12.15.15 update] -- nice; they were originally full bright, which was distracting in a dark setting.- theres just the slightest amount of light leak from between the screen and capacitive buttons, over the Back button -- but only noticeable in a dark room- the Maxx pixels per inch (PPI) display density works out to 296 PPI across the 5 screen. The Gnex screen was slightly smaller (4.7 -- less if you consider on-screen buttons took up some of that space), so despite it being the same resolution, would have been 316 PPI -- except for its shared-pixel Pentile display. Ive seen the case made that the Pentile display dropped the effective PPI down to the 200 range. I cant say I ever took issue with that screen by Samsung, but I could see jaggies on certain websites, and those just arent present on the Maxx -- this display, overall, appears sharper.Theres going to be an adjustment period for me, no doubt, but despite some of the negatives Ive listed, I dont consider any of these to be deal breakers.I mentioned the capacitive buttons. Versus the on-screen buttons found on the Moto X and Gnex, these ones are ever-present. Accessing Google Now takes a slightly paused press of the home button before swiping up, vs. the simple swipe motion (no hold) of an on-screen home button. And some older apps still call up the 3-dot menu button which takes up a whole nother row (a black menu bar across the entire bottom of the display). On phones with the virtual buttons on-screen, the main three (Back, Home, and Task) would simply make room for the skinny 3-dot -- making it all the more obscene that when it appears on the Maxx, it takes up its own row. To get around that, I can go into Settings and enable a long press of task switcher option. That gets rid of the wasted screen, but now I have to remember which apps use this long press to access the menu (and some apps only do this on certain screens). This should be less and less of a problem as developers update their apps, as I believe the standard for the OS v4.0 and higher is to display the menu ellipses at the top right corner of the application.+++ Speaking of OS, my phone came with Jelly Bean 4.2.2, but units shipping now ought to have KitKat 4.4 installed (or otherwise readily downloadable via an easily access Check For Updates selection in the Settings > About Phone > System Updates menu). If youre coming from a Gnex, KitKat is basically the same, only snappier. If youre coming from Ice Cream Sandwich or Gingerbread, I guarantee youll be impressed with the smoothness and overall look/feel of this operating system.Im still setting up my various apps and checking them for compatibility. Im not going to attempt to generate a comprehensive list of what does / doesnt work, but here are some quick notes:- /// As of the 4.4.4 update, on-againg/off-again FoxFi is no longer compatible for WiFi tethering. Youll have to resort to USB tethering instead.- >>> As of 11/12/13, FoxFi is compatible for tethering. It *requires* a PIN-enabled lock screen (not pattern) due to some VPN nonsense that I admittedly dont completely understand (FoxFi was great on the Galaxy Nexus, and didnt require this)- +++ Google Wallet tap-to-pay IS supported with as of the KitKat OS -- an app Ive been running on the Gnex since about week one.  Cruel irony, my purchase of the Maxx was my last Google Wallet NFC transaction before the KitKat update (Verizon clerk: Oh, Ive never seen THAT before! as I swiped my Nexus across her payment terminal)- YouTube updated me to version 5.0, which I was not yet able to access on the Play Store from my Gnex or my TF700T tablet- Swype keyboard is working A-Ok, and pops up nearly instantly when called- +++ Nova Launcher is working A-Ok; mic icon in persistent search bar (shortcut to Google Now) calls up the voice recognition screen nearly instantly; [new KitKat option for transparent notification bar works as demonstrated on Nexus KitKat devices]- Sound Profile app by Corcanoe is A-Ok without any of the problems / workarounds experienced by Galaxy S4 users- The stock Android dialer app has been enhanced to allow dialing by first or last name, or partial phone number -- nothing new for users of skinned versions of Android (Touchwiz, Sense, Motoblur) or other OSs, but a feature requiring an aftermarket app for stock Nexus users; alas, no updated 4.4.4 dialer as seen on Nexus devices- +++ OK Google Now is quick, responsive, and  pretty awesome... but less so with a lock screen [New with KitKat: with user permission, the phone allows certain voice commands to process even if the phone is locked; actions requiring an unlock allow the user to speak the PIN code]- Set alarm for ten a.m. used to take me directly to the stock clock app, even though I had alternate alarm applications installed. No longer; Im now given the option to default to whichever one I choose (tested with Timely and Alarm Clock Xtreme); no such luck with set timer for three minutes, which still just sets an alarm for whatever time is closest to 3 minutes from now- As expected, logging in with my Google credentials automatically downloaded all my apps and contacts, with the exception, oddly enough, of Facebook- Not exactly an app, but the brightness slider from the main pull-down menu is very picky, doesnt like switching back to Auto, and times out quickly -- but works fine from Power Control widget- +++ Theres a bug in the task switcher where not all open apps appear -- including the app Im currently using (this originally was the same with the Gnex, but was changed in a recent OS update). [This seems to have been partially resolved with KitKat -- it still happens, but less frequently.]- +++ [Settings > Apps now has a dedicated Disabled Apps view to allow me to see all the unwanted Verizon pre-installed goodies Ive exiled from my app drawer. They used to appear at the bottom of the lists.]- /// Ive been using the LEEF microSD card reader for added storage; with 4.4.4 USB OTG means this reader is natively supported (using your preferred file manager such as Astro)+++ The Camera [post 12.15.15 update & post KitKat observations]: Im now super happy with the camera. Images were always as sharp as can be expected from a cell phone, with good, natural colors. Theres no longer a problem with highly contrasted scenes (original firmware couldnt handle bright backlighting, such as under a canopy of trees with a bright sky in the background). Ill continue to rely on my compact camera outfitted with anEye-Fi Mobiwhen Im looking for best clarity and dynamic range, but the Maxxs results are definitely suitable for everyday, in-the-moment type shots. Under KitKat, Tap-To-Focus has been replaced with Drag-To-Focus: drag the focal bracket anywhere on the screen to set the focal point and exposure; tapping anywhere on the screen releases the shutter. Holding my finger press captures a multiple exposures at a rate of one frame per second (and displays a convenient counter), great for automatic GIF animation by the magic behind Google Plus (which I have set up to auto-upload my pics). The updated camera UI moves the mode dial to a large arc along the left edge, and utilizes that nifty twist yer wrist technique to pop directly into camera mode from sleep, like the Moto X (and no unlock PIN required). Theres also a half-decent slo-mo video mode, which is fun for well-lit scenes of fast moving objects, or just a honey bee landing on a flower. The HDR mode is incrementally improved with OS 4.4 -- still not on par with true 3-frame HDR post-processing, but an acceptable substitute for scenes where compromised lighting would otherwise challenge these rinky-dink sensors. As of the 12.15.15 update, the camera software now appears to be updated as an app in Google Play, which ought to mean no more delays waiting for Verizon to vet the software via their slowest in the biz OS update process.The flash is dimmer and yellower than what Ive become accustom to on my Nexus, but this is only evident when Im using it as a flashlight. In flash-filled photos, the cameras white balance is adjusted appropriately for the non-exactly-white LED, and as long as my expectations arent too high (i.e. subjects are within 6-10 feet of the camera and Im not trying to light a whole room), the photos seem to be adequately focused, and in a matter of only a second or two. But dont expect youre going to freeze any poorly-lighted motion with this shooter, and expect to see a good amount of noise at full rez. This isnt a Nokia, after all!The operating system is pretty dang close to stock Android. Motorola threw some extras in there for the camera and photo sharing, plus a widget or two, and of course theres a whole bevy of Verizon bloat including NFL, MyVZW, visual voicemail, VZW nav, etc... even a caller ID service that sneakily activates, then tries to enroll the user for monthly billing. But with 32 gigs of memory on board, a little attention paid, and the ability to quarantine these apps, theyre hardly a bother. The phones interface is pure Google.In that list of apps up above, I pointedly mention the delay-free call-ups of the Swype keyboard and the Google Now microphone icon. Launching these actions had been increasingly bogged down on my Nexus, I believe due to memory management issues. Androids TRIM memory management in Android 4.4 should prevent that on this phone.+++ The OK Google Now voice wake (well, really, it works when the phone is already awake, too) is shaping up to be more than a gimmick. After an initial voice training session in a quiet place, I OK Google Nowd my phone where it sat on the passenger seat cushion. Navigate to work (work already being defined in my Google Now account) and, bingo, Im hearing Googles familiar, clear directions. Same with text messages to my wife, and setting an alarm. One step closer to hands free. With KitKat, many actions such as Navigation or alarm settings can be voice-initiated without entering a PIN or Pattern unlock. If I dictate a text to my wife, after voice-composing the message and verifying the recipient, the Maxx will prompt Say or type PIN code before sending, for a true hands free interaction!+++ Although regarding pin/pattern unlock, the Maxx offers up a cool option (excuse me if this is old news -- new to me) to recognize trusted Bluetooth devices, and gives the option to leave the phone unlocked as long as it remains in range. Think car, smartwatch, a generic USB dongle in a home or office PC, etc. -- the phone will only lock down when it walks away out of signal range of one of these trusted Bluetooth devices. [However, Ive deactivated this built-in feature for a paid app called SkipLock, which does the same, but with WiFi, too, and it works extremely well.]Oh... face unlock makes a reappearance, too. I actually used that a bit on the Gnex.I cant post this review without mentioning the all-important connectivity. The radios are great -- both 4G & wifi.- In my basement, where Ive struggled to pull a 3G signal on the Gnex, I maintained a 4G connection on the Maxx, which allowed me to download apps (initial phone setup) while watching an HD video on YouTube- On the main floor of the house, where my signal would flip between 3G and 4G on the Gnex, the Maxx operates decidedly in 4G territory- At work, one room in the office far removed from the wifi antenna would consistently go to zero bars (yet, frustratingly, not lose it completely and therefore would not switch over to the strong 4G signal), I now have at least one wifi bar accompanied by a usable flow of data- Overall, switching between wifi and 4G on the margins seems improved vs. what I had before, though even with ignore weak wifi connections checked, the Maxx at times seems indecisive about switching from one to the other. If I have one wifi bar thats trickling data, and a 3-bar 4G signal available, the choice should be obvious- No problem with Bluetooth connections; Im stoked that I now have full integration with my Fords Sync system, with artist/track tagging from Pandora, and read-out-loud messaging with canned replies- Voice call quality overall is excellent. This is one of Motorolas strong suits, I hear. Im impressed.Do you remember the iPhone 4s death grip problem? It seems that in marginal 4G areas (like that signal-quashing basement I mentioned), turning the Droid Maxx to landscape mode and holding it with both hands causes it to show a drop of 5 to 10 dBm off the signal strength meter (Settings > More > Mobile Networks > Network Type and Strength). If Im already in the (low strength) -115 to -120 range, this results in me completely losing 3G and 4G connectivity. Releasing one hand brings the signal back to life. Where my 4G signal is strong, the signal drop is there, but my connection remains intact.Ive taken GPS accuracy for granted for a few years, so I was surprised to notice the Maxxs sense of direction may be slightly off. I use Google Nav frequently, and on a couple of occasions, the Maxx seemed to think I strayed off course onto the streets vs. getting on the freeway on-ramp, or exited when I really stayed on the highway, and as such gives me a fast re-route and impossible directions. It (well, Google Nav) then quickly corrects itself. Id chock this up to accepted errors in compacted urban driving environments, except that the Gnex, previous Garmin devices, and Ford GPS simply dont exhibit this behavior. It would only be a problem if I already screwed up and missed a turn, but this nevertheless results in confusing instructions. Though other than those relatively minor blips, location setting is fast and mostly accurate, even in many indoor settings.Another point to mention: Heat. My Galaxy Nexus often ran hot. When it did, I knew it was busy with something that was burning through the battery. This phone has run even hotter, both times in the car plugged in. The first was just downloading apps, the second was also running Nav with the screen on the whole time. But Ive yet to see it run this hot outside of the car, and in fact, in the car running Nav but not plugged in, and not downloading apps, is was perfectly cool (and only lost 4% of the charge over about 20 minutes of Nav + screen-on time). So Im guessing the heat comes from the 4G radio and processor working overtime switching cell sites, transferring data, and unpacking / installing applications, though again, this isnt the case when its doing those same tasks sitting still in the house (and on 4G).Check back. Im sure Ill have some more detail to add to this already too-long review as I get to know this phone, particularly with respect to battery life, application compatibility problems & successes, and more observations on the radio switching & possible death grip issue.But in summary, Im sticking with my title -- this phone may have some issues here and there, and it may not be the fastest/biggest/most beautiful/polished specimen out there this late summer and fall, but in my opinion its the first suitable contender to supersede the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, and betters that phone in a number of key areas. I have a great deal of confidence in Motorola at this time -- both in their tie to Google, and their strong affiliation with VZW. Thankfully, if youre tied to Verizon, youve suddenly got a few good choices after a long drought./// The 4.4.4 update continues with minor polishing and not much in the way of big features -- some supposed camera improvements, some slight bug fixes, and couple of minor UI tweaks, and the switchover to the ART runtime -- which Im seeing is resulting in a couple of apps not running, but should result in snappier performance for those that have addressed this. What Im not seeing yet? Device mirroring Chromcasting (none of the Droids are on the compatibility list), and an upgrade path to Android L (again, not on any lists Ive seen). This continues to be a good phone, and a good buy at a discounted price. Were at that point where the device is stable and mature, but there are new options on the horizon, so although my rating stands, its probably time to look at newer or up-and-coming phones."}

{"id": 408, "text": "This thing is sweet. I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave. It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off. Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book. This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right. All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it. The only thing I didnt like was that this does not come with a holster. I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt. Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove. It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I cant remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster. I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from Rhino brand. The ones I have were Black Rhino. I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case."}

{"id": 444, "text": "Overall, this device delivers satisfactory basic functionality: it successfully connects with a Bluetooth device to transmit content via an FM transmitter. If the device is a phone, it will also permit you to take and make phone calls via the Bluetooth connection.In practice, it has some quirks regarding its discovery of available FM frequencies. I live in an area with a crowded FM dial with signals from two major metro areas and parts of four states. Unused FM broadcast frequencies are few..and the F8M1217ttn does NOT agree with me about which ones are available. Its ClearScan automated frequency selector often bypasses idle FM broadcast frequencies in favor of ones that are in use.In addition, the quality of the FM transmission quality can vary widely with the positioning of the this device. An arms-length of difference in where you locate it can mean the difference between loud/clear transmission and content that is overcome by static.Im also  not a fan of devices that expect you to use adhesive on a dashboard, which is the recommended use case for this model.The market is crowded with offerings from many manufacturers at this price: this model is simply part of that pack..."}

Very close to being identical, but a few minor changes. The earphone cutout seems to be a bit larger than the 4s case, which Im very happy about. Also, the material itself, the same, but I think just a tad bit stiffer, which is neither here nor there for me. Excellent grip, I never get that sinking feeling you get when your phone slips out of your sweaty hand and time seems to stop for a moment when you see your precious iPhone falling... falling... then BAM! Hits the floor with a thud, and now you have a cracked screen and scratches. Nope! not me. I have a Magpul! If you want some serious grip (from the makers of gun grips), excellent drop protection, a lay-on-the-table design, slim profile, non-sticky easy-slip-into-pocket material, and a snap in design with an open face for your phone, look no further. You need this. And if youre worried about that beautiful Retina display, there are a wide variety of screen protectors out there. Oh, and yes, this case plays nice with protectors."}

{"id": 527, "text": "I bought this battery pack for an upcoming trip so I wouldnt have to worry about finding power outlets in potentially crowded airports...something my wife and I ran into the last time we flew.  I didnt think Id use this until the trip, but a couple of weeks ago I decided meh, I may as well see how it works *now* before Im stuck relying on it later.I charged it up per the instructions, then took my phone (Android Motorola Razr...plain Razr, not M, or HD, or anything else) and sat in the living room and plugged in the battery.  My phone was somewhere around 20% charge.  Around 60-90ish minutes later (I cant remember exactly how long), I picked my phone up expecting to see it was at, say, 40% charge.  Wrong.  100%.  I then played with it for awhile and saw the battery level slowly drop as I would expect it to from web browsing and playing games.  My phone was completely charged in an hour.  Holy cow.Ive since used it to charge my sister-in-laws phone when she popped by for a few hours (under 10% charge to like 98% charge in about the same time), and have used it several times on my own phone after work.  All told, Ive probably recharged about 6 full charges on it, and have just NOW plugged it in to recharge the battery pack itself.Im seriously debating buying a second one just to keep in the car.  Sure, like everyone else, Ive got a car charger, but that thing is sloooooow...one recent trip with poor cell service saw that between that, GPS, and bluetooth showed that the car charger simply wasnt putting out enough power to keep the battery charged.  Im certain that this battery pack would have been able to handle it!Ive recommended this to *all* of my friends who I know have phones (and other devices) that are constantly being run almost entirely out of power, and would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a fast, solid charge at their fingertips!**Post-trip edit**Wow.  Just...wow.  If you dont already own one of these, go buy one.  Right now.  This thing was in my pocket almost all day every day, dutifully keeping my cell charged.  It worked fantastically on the plane ride to and from (which was great, as I didnt have to scrounge around for an unused power socket), and the one time I spaced bringing it with me, my phone died and I wasnt able to take pics of that part of the vacation.  I have been singing the praises of this battery pack to everyone I know.If youve got a battery powered device and often find yourself running low on power...get one of these!"}

The watch sits too high on the wrist due to the clamp on the watch to hook it to the strap. Sony should have redesigned the watch without this elevated clamp. Put normal watch-strap connectors on the sides of the main watch face and thus eliminate the need for the raised bottom clamp. Then, this watch would look and feel much more like a watch and not some weird elevated square sitting on the wrist. Just a poorly designed tech gadget with a flakey touch screen."}

Any case that is worth using is going to add bulk, but this one doesnt add too much. It adds just enough to make the phone more hand friendly but is still easy to get in and out of pockets. It does a good job of keeping dust and debris out of the inside so your phone doesnt get all scratched up while in the case. Ive had other well known cases this would happen in.

The slot for cards is absolutely great. You can really lighten your load by carrying your most important cards with your phone. In college, I dont need to always carry around my wallet to classes anymore, just in case I wanted to stop for something to eat or drink. I could just take my phone, and have my student ID and main credit card with me.And everyone loved it too. I was always asked what this case was and where I got it, it was a hit in social situations.But I ultimately decided against it for everyday use. I got myself a front pocket wallet, and put an InvisiShield on my iphone 5.Why?Well, I realized that the iphones kept getting thinner and thinner, smaller and smaller. They look so sleek and so nice, especially the iphone 5. Getting a card case like this one keeps the phone safe and makes things convenient, but it basically takes a killer feature of the iphone (its stunning thin-ness) and renders it obsolete. The phone looks like a brick, basically. And I didnt want that.I used the Candy Shell card case with my 4S all the time. From the moment I bought it to the moment I got the 5. But I couldnt keep up with this one as long. I realized that the iphone is so beautifully thin, I just had to go without a case.

Completely covers the screen from edge to edge unlike some other brand protectors that come close but still miss the mark by like 1/32 mm on the edges. The finish on the one I ordered was matte, it feels great, fingers glide across the screen even when humid, unlike glossy protectors. Also, it seriously resists fingerprints. Sure, you may still need to wipe down the screen at the end of the day, but not nearly as much as if you had a glossy finish. I strongly recommend MediaDevil protectors. A British company, not Chinese. Although probably manufactured in Asia, but up to the MediaDevil standards. Mine even came with candy in the package, a nice thought."}

{"id": 645, "text": "I received this packge on time and in prime working order.  I had just had my youngest son (30+) give me a huge lecture on why I needed to have a better AC wall charger and what I needed to look for in such a purchase. I was so happy to see this product hit my mail box.  I have charged each of my Android products.  I could not use any of the other AC chargers I had or it would flash across my divice screen &#34;not charging&#34;.  So one by one I plugged into each USB port.  Some would charge on the first port, others had to be used on the bottom.To be honest, thats not much of a problem for me.  I was just EX (as in ex those other chargers are ex) tatic to see one product that charged any device I had.  I might just have to interject here, that they all charged, and all charged faster than any one older AC unit I had.  From flat as death to 50% it charged from 1/2 to 2.5 hours.  That was a great savings of something we all need more of.  TIME.This unit did not come with cables, but I have cables galore anyways, so, not a problem.I just plugged in each product.  Looked to see if it was charging and let the magic happen.  And it did.MY iphones 3, and 4 and my I pad 3 all charged fine on the second USB port (from top of unit to bottom,  #1 top #2 bottom)My ipad 3 would not charge in #1 USB port. but did #2)My Poloroid tabled would not charge #1 USB port, but did  #2)My Kendle 16GB hd worked (both #! and #2)My Bluetooth keyboards, (3) their USB ports (both #1 and #2)My iphone bluetooth handfree mic. units all charged (3) with their USB ports (both #! and #2)My Nook 16GB hd worked (both #1 and #2)My Game boy advances (2) worked (used the USB converted)My one touch blood sugar moitor worked (both #1 and #2)Ok folks, this is getting old  whatever had a USB cord would charge on this unit.  All of them.  Amazing!There will be lots of debate about both ports should work on all products at all time.  But, alas, we live in an imperfect world, and what in the world do you expect for such a fantastic price.All in all this was a great charger at a great value.  I appreciate everything about it.I would have given five stars but better packaging would have been beneficial.  The unit is well built, however, instructions on up and down what port to use for what would have been a better choice for the company.  I would suspect this will change, as all things do as time and input from all users come in, explaining why it would be best for the company to do so.I liked that the prongs were foldable, but that wasnt what impressed me.  I liked the way the charger fit sideways onto my wall socket & or plug in strip.  Being able to put the proper amonuts of plug ins to the plug ins is good.  I have to tell you that getting rid of about six chargers placed around my house to one charger, on my desk.  That was priceless to me.  I would recommend this product to just about anyone, as I think it would servic most homes who have many multiple devices."}

{"id": 652, "text": "I would say this this product is definitely an improvement from a previous model that was rated at about 12,000 mAh. The previous model had a shiny surface, which does look cool, but also attracts fingerprints. Often times, when I am charging my phone, I will actually hold this with my phone. The surface on this newer unit, with a more textured surface, and vertical ridges, give this unit a nicer grip. I dont worry about this charger sliding around on a tabletop.As far as charging goes, I think that this product took a cue fromt he IMP90C (or vice versa), and went with a single, dim LED light to indicate the different charging status. The button to turn the charger on is located on the corner of this unit, so it is unlikely that you will accidentally turn this unit on.For actual charging use, I decided to bring this unit with me to a four-day swim meet. I would use this device to charge my iPhone 4S whenever my battery ran down. I am proud to report that after four days, I was able to recharge my iPhone to 100% for each of the four days! This is a great portable charger, and I think that it is a must have for anyone that has a smart phone or tablet."}

There must be different versions of this charger, as the one I received is more square, and without the blue accents. As a charger, this charger is okay for charging two smaller devices such as phones. However, if youre looking at charging a tablet and phone, it will charge the tablet at a slower rate. I observed this when trying to charge my ipad 3 and iphone 5 together. My charger is rated at 2.1A max output I was also unable to charge my phone and a kindle fire at the higher rate, but I will have to try and switch ports as some have said that the ports are different amperages even though they are not labeled. The folding prongs helps it be more compact for traveling, and the indicator light is a nice touch to help you remember it. At this price point, it is a decent deal."}
{"id": 661, "text": "This is by far the sturdiest case and holster combo I have ever purchased for a phone. It went together with ease and the way they engineered it, it is very tight to the phone. The only thing I didnt like about it was the built in screen protector. I tried it for a while to see if I could get used to it but eventually I pulled it out of the top cover and went with a standard screen protector from ISmooth. It just didnt feel right to me. I had no issues with the screen protector not functioning or with loss of  touch screen sensitivity. I just flat out didnt care for it. You may love it, its a &#34;me&#34; thing. The holster is just as stout as the case and I dont see it breaking at the clip while getting in and out of cars like some cheaper models. If you dont mind the extra bulk added to an already large phone and I am referring to my Galaxy Note 2, than this is the case for you. I only wish that they came in different colors."}

The only problem was I was getting tired of carrying around a bulky phone all the time. My OEM battery was getting pretty beat up, and got really really hot after a while. So, after some searching, I found this little set and I couldnt be happier.PROS: TWO BATTERIES! This is such an amazing idea, and it works flawlessly. Each one lasts me at least a day with heavy gps, wifi, and screen time. The batteries last longer than my old stock battery, and its so nice having an extra battery laying around in case I dont have time to charge the one in my phone. The wall charger works exactly like it should, and always charges to 100%. I read reviews that plugging in the battery dosent fully charge the phone, but I have never had a problem.CONS: Warranty sticker falls off very easy, so I hope if I ever have to return this, they dont give me guff for the warranty sticker falling off. The battery charger feels very cheap, but it charges the batteries just fine. I tried charging my 7000mAh battery, but it wouldnt charge all the way...havent messed around with any other batteries.OVERALL: Im a sucker for replaceable batteries. I have a Hyperion 4200mAh extended battery, ZeroLemon 7000mAh battery, stock battery, and this set. I dont like having to worry about power. This set has been in use for a month now, and besides the occasional overnight camping trip where I need alot of juice (the 7000mAh big boy), this has been my go-to battery set. Super efficient, great battery life, and I can finally use all my old cases again! Oh, and the price makes this a no-brainer. ZEROLEMON FO (battery) LIFE!!!!"}

{"id": 671, "text": "I have bought several budget lightening cables and all have been useless or broken within weeks.  I wanted a better cable without paying the price or an Apple branded cable.  These have pretty good reviews and the price was pretty good.  I almost went with the Amazon Basics but this seemed like the better value.  I was so confident that I bought two cables.First the good:Very solid build.  These cables feel substantial.  The cable itself is a thicker gauge and does not bend as much as the Apple cable.  That is a good thing.  The biggest fail points on the Apple cable are the plug itself (gets dirty quickly and stops working) and the junction of the cable and the plug housing.  This is not a concern on the Belkins as they are solidly built.  I also had no issue with them fitting on our various devices regardless of case.Now the not so good:They dont work as consistently as the Apples.  The cables work on some devices but not on others.  Why?  Could this be the fault of my devices?  Perhaps but I expect the cables to work on any device that a branded Apple cable works in and this is not the case.  This happens with BOTH cables.Long and short of this all is these are not what I hoped they would be and I probably should just buy the Apple brand next time regardless of price."}

The green light looks cool, but is super bright.  Keep this in mind where your cars aux input is close to where it may shine in your face while driving.  I plug mine in the aux input of my cars armrest so its hidden.  My car has a 2nd aux power input on the dash board which causes the LED green light to be distracting during night drive conditions.  The cord and plug feel like quality materials.  The length of cord is nice and long so you can place your iPod anywhere in your car.  Some chargers have short cords which limit the distance how far you can place your iPod in relation to aux input outlet location.UPDATE: I installed an Otterbox Defender case for my iPod 5g and now this plug wont fit in the power jack on device.  It fits fine without the case, but beware most protective cases will only work with STOCK power cord, unless your after market cord plug end is very thin.  This Belkin one is a little thick so I cant use it with Otterbox case on my iPod.  I still use the aux jack plug in my car tho as a charging outlet with the stock iPod cord."}

The Slim &#34;Armor&#34; plates are interchangeable with other plates from Spigen that come in several colors for the Slim Armor.

{"id": 691, "text": "This is WAY overpriced. Its not even really made for the S4, its a generic case for any phone with a MicroUSB charger in the middle-bottom. Because of its universal design the phone does not sit securely in it. It also doesnt work with even a slim case (Belkin claims its made for cases with an open bottom, I have never seen a bottomless case for the S4) and it doesnt come with a wall plug. For $30 they need to include a wall plug AND an adapter so you can use it with a case. Additionally a $30 stand should hold my phone securely, this case doesnt the phone is so wobbly that it will often come loose and stop charging. There are plenty of better options for charging your S4.Note: I noticed that for some reason Amazon thinks reviews for 3 different stands should be lumped together, rendering the average rating useless as its actually the average for 3 different devices. The three stands are different, so make sure you look at the top of the review to see if its actually for your model."}
{"id": 692, "text": "Having previously enjoyed a Palm Treo dock that looks much the same as this one, perhaps I expected too much from this new dock for my Samsung Galaxy S4. Like the Treo dock, it holds the phone upright while charging. However, unlike the Treo dock, it does not also charge a spare battery, a feature I definitely miss on this dock.Using this with myAmazonBasics Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 -Black, I also find I have to keep the cover open in order for the charge/sync connection to be made. That was somewhat expected, so no biggie, but kind of ugly. Also expected is the lack of an AC charger. Again, no biggie. I already have a drawer full of those.Overall, this Belkin charge/sync dock works, but doesnt add obvious value over simply plugging my S4 into theMonoprice 1.5-Feet 28AWG USB 2.0 A Male to 5-pin micro-B Male Cable, Blackit replaced, and takes up more space on my dresser and in my travel bag to do so. The single best feature may be the included 3 USB cable extender, which Im sure will eventually be useful.Would I order it again? Not unless it also charged my spare battery."}
{"id": 693, "text": "First issue I noted was that the design of the holder and micro USB port will not work with an S4 with an Otterbox Defender. A simple modification to the case would allow for it to fit or they could have included an extension micro-micro usb adapter to raise it up. I found it nearly impossible to locate a micro USB adapter but finally did on ebay (shipped from China!). The device is way over priced. It is probably worth half this at around $12.99.

My charger is fine but charges slowly. The charging light takes overnight to change color.  It should work for the Samsung Galaxy S3, S4, and S4 Active.These batteries do not include NFC (used for making easy, simple bluetooth operations like connecting to a NFC-enabled headset).  So they are not exact replacements for genuine Samsung batteries.They are a bit difficult to push into the phone - probably because of the thickness of the labels.  However they do fit.

{"id": 712, "text": "When i first bought this, I gave it a 4 star review. I was being foolishly optimistic at the time.Straight away, I had two concerns: one cosmetic, and one functional. Cosmetically, I like where the USB out ports are, but the micro USB in port sucks. Its located on the side, so trying to run this with a solar panel means dealing with a mess of tangled wires. It also puts the charge cable in a position where it is likely to get banged around & damaged. My initial intent was to pair this with an Instapark 10 watt solar system, but quickly realized this wasnt much of an option due to the second concern I had: charging times. This battery takes forever to charge. The first charge I put on this was via a 1 amp wall charger, and it took nearly 18 hours to charge. To get the same charge from the Instapark panels would take 2 really good sunny days minimum. Couple that with the overnight break in charging, and suddenly you are injuring this batterys expected lifespan (manufacturer suggests 500 recharges).Those were my initial issues. Ive now had this battery about 8 weeks, and I fully regret wasting money on it. That initial 18 hour charge was by far the fastest one yet, despite using various other chargers ranging up to 5volts with 2000mAh output. As it sits right now, the battery was plugged in shortly before noon yesterday, and it is now after 4PM. In the past 28+ hours, this battery shows it has charged between half & 3/4 of the way. I tested the cable to make sure it wasnt defective, but it is working great. It is still putting enough juice out to charge my Kindle Fire, Android phone, and the few other items Ive tested it on. So, I check the battery to see if it is working. Its not.Update: Shortly after posting this review, i was contacted by Anker. Their customer care dept has been very polite, professional, and have taken the initiative to help resolve the issues Ive had with their product. They recently shipped a replacement product, which I received last night. Between now and the holidays, I should have more than ample time to run this thing through its paces again, and Ill update this review again, either good or bad, in a few weeks.Thank you Anker support team for all your help. Sonnie has been very professional and polite throughout our communications. Cheers!"}

{"id": 720, "text": "Right up front Ill tell you that I love Spigen products.  Ive owned many of their cases and written glowing reviews of them all.  This case, unfortunately, falls way short of my expectations.The biggest problem is that you cant plug anything into your phone with this case, except the original Samsung micro USB cable and the smallest of headphones.  I dont know about everyone else, but Ive been acquiring micro USB chargers for years and theyre scattered throughout my house/car/office.  Not being able to use any of them with my S4 while wearing this case is extremely frustrating.  It means I have to carry around my Samsung OEM cable with me everywhere I go.As for the headphones, I use either Shure SE315s or Sennheiser HD280s and with this case, the plug wont fully seat into the phone so I cant get any audio.  Seriously?  So now I have to buy a little pigtail, or use a pair of Apple Earbuds?  I dont think so.And so, Im returning the case.  Buyers beware!  Many of you wont care about these problems, but some of you will and youll want to steer clear of this case."}
{"id": 721, "text": "This case is very nice, but your paying almost double than what you would for other cases.  I makes the phone slightly wider and taller than the other cases but its no thicker than the thinnest snap on cases.  I also have a Rinke slim and this is equally as thin. I did notice that talking on speaker phone is more difficult as the microphone is now buried inside, but speaking into it with it near your face is fine.  Definitely worth it if you want full protection while maintaining a minimalist look compared to the other cases that turn the phone into a brick."}

If you cant count on the cord working, it is no good.  Agreed, apple charges too much for these, but the hassle of return and having a dead battery when you were counting on being able to make a phone call is not worth the few extra $$$ .They also charge $3.20 for a restocking fee.  For a defective item which they cant re-sell."}

{"id": 727, "text": "Lets face it, most of us will be wedded to our current smartphone until our contract runs out. And high end smartphones are very expensive to replace if you damage them. This case gives you the best shot at making it past the two year mark without damaging your phone through inadvertent drops, scratches, flexes, and the like.This case appears substantial, and cradles the Galaxy S4 without any pressure points. By all accounts it looks well made and capable of doing a good job of protecting its contents (though Ive not tried the protection by dropping the phone yet).The main drawback of this case is that it takes a slim, good looking phone and makes it look like a kids toy. Theres a thick rubberized cover completely covering five sides of the phone. All buttons and ports are accessible, but the whole thing looks like its more fit for a worksite rather than a corporate setting. Elegance and beauty are lost in the quest for protection.Its a tradeoff of elegance versus protection. I traded off the former for the latter."}

{"id": 734, "text": "I cut the cord quite a while ago and have been running Internet + over-the-air for quite some time and actually had been looking at this before it was available on Vine.  I was pretty excited to get it as sometimes I work late at the office but want to catch a show (Im too lazy to DVR it).Set-up was a breeze, download the app and plug it into the 30-pin connector.  I tried this on an iPhone 4 and latest iPad.  You have to enter a zip code and email address which Im generally not fond of.  Why do I have to register my email address to use their product, it should be optional.  The zip code requirement made me wonder if I would be able to use this if I go to another market.I entered the information and took me to a screen on what was available...2 and one of them was PBS.  With the HD antennae, I get about 25.  Ok, clicked on NBC and it took me to another blank screen.  Sat there...sat there...sat there...blank screen...blank screen.  I checked the coverage map before and I should of been fine.  No indication its doing anything or that I should wait...juts a blank screen.  No whirly hour-glass, not connecting....  Finally after 3-4 mins (studies show after 10 seconds people get bored waiting for tech), a picture showed.  Was pretty fuzzy, waited for it to clear up like buffering on streaming videos.  Nope, was kind of like 320x200 blown up to iPad size so it was pixelated.The sound stopped about every 10-15 seconds on cue.  Checking my connection with their tool, it was on the lower side of green, say 7 out of 10.  Compared it to the Live NBC channel and they delay it about 10 seconds.I stopped it, reloaded it.  This time it came up much faster but still slow.  Like 45 seconds which in this short attention span world is akin to infinity+infinity.  Same poor delayed picture with the sound going out every 10-15 sec.so to summarize:Pros:-easy set up-does not use wi-fi/internet-no subscription (fees) requiredCons:-pricey-poor picture quality-sound issue-very limited channels (depends on market, STL is not one of the major cities but still its pretty big...)-long boot/init-have to register just to use what you just paid for-may be limited to markets you can use-only available in certain areas, check coverage map-un-usable on the road/road-trip since coverage is only in major city limits-it uses a watch-style battery, meaning you probably dont have a stock of them.  but it doesnt use iPad juice-sure, so it waves 10 mins on your iPad for a long haul...only now you have to get special batteries once in a while and have no idea when it will go out as there is no indicatorIt would be worth it if I could get the major channels in HD with decent picture and un-interrupted sound but its not there yet.  Maybe they will resolve the issues in the future."}

{"id": 742, "text": "Arcadia ArcPak 7.4 is a big charge in a small package.  When you dont want something as heavy as the PowerPak+ this is the right product for you. The 7400mAH charge power balances weight against endurance to just the right place.  I charged my iPhone 5 every night.  It was usually at or below 50% charge remaining.  The ArcPak lasted 6 days before recharging. During that time I topped off my Kindle Fire twice.  The double USB outlets lets you charge 2 devices at the same time. The ArcPak recharged in about 6 hours and came from the factory already fully charged and ready to go.  Great for when you arent close to an A/C outlet to plug in your phone charger or dont want to be tethered to the wall and still use your phone or other mobile device.  It keeps you mobile.  For ladies you can just keep your phone, mp3 player or iPad type device plugged into the charger in your purse and be fully charged all the time.  I highly recommend this extra battery power for anyone on the go that runs their battery down before the day is done.  Great for using on air planes when you have no A/C.  It will give you a full charge for an entire day without having to find a wall socket or a cigarette lighter jack.  After using the PowerPak+ I like the lighter weight if this baby.  It makes a big difference if you are carrying it around all day in your bag or pocket.This is a must have for me."}

{"id": 746, "text": "There are a lot of Bluetooth rechargeable speakers on the market these days. Most are smaller and lighter weight than this Philips model. The Philips P8 weighs almost 3 pounds and uses its bigger size and weight to produce better bass than most of the competition. I thought the treble was adequately crisp, but that depends on the type of music you play as well as the quality of your Bluetooth connection. This speaker does tend to emphasize bass, so that may drown out your treble at full volume.The Philips P8 looks nice with an all-black aluminum case. While the speaker is big on the front, it is relatively thin and easy to carry in a briefcase or backpack. They even include a carrying bag, since portability is obviously a big feature of a rechargeable speaker.Pairing with my Android smartphone was quick and easy. Just click on the Philips P8 entry in the phones discovered Bluetooth device list.My only real complaint is that it uses a non-standard charger (not micro-USB), so you will have to pack the special charger with you when traveling (and dont ever lose it). The Philips charger probably charges the battery faster than say an ipad charger, but at least having the option to use a USB charger in a pinch would be a nice touch."}

No lights when you are charging other objects, but honestly they have charging indicators on their screens so it isnt really necessary.Only minor issue I had was that seller contacted me a few days after order and told me that the lot of black units they had on hand were defective and wanted to know if a pink one could be substituted.  I said yes and covered the pink anodizing with a piece of tape.  Now that Ive used it for a bit Im thinking a piece of shrink tubing is in order for a more permanent fix.

This is lovely, no more having to carry around that dumb proprietary Apple cable.It did take me a few minutes to figure out how to put it ON the phone.  I suppose it should have been intuitively obvious that it pulls apart in the middle, but maybe I needed more coffee that day.  I was afraid I would break it by pulling it apart that way.  But thats exactly what you need to do.It makes the phone heavier and larger, which might be a problem for someone who carries their phone in a purse with a special cell phone pocket.  It does fit in my purse but its a tight fit with this case installed.Oh, and if you need emergency power for your iPod, this case will work for that also, though of course the form factor isnt right.  I slid my own iPod in and kept it going for many hours and of course you can charge it (again) without the proprietary cable.Nice job, Belkin!"}

The cord is extremely lightweight.Now for the sound, the best part. Oh my, these far surpass anything Ive tried. My ultimate test is listening to Vivaldis Concerto No. 1 in G Minor. I could hear every instrument just like I was in a concert hall. It was beautiful. Next, I tried some pop music - Best Song Ever by One Direction was popping with exceptional bass. The piano was crisp and clear in Just Give Me a Reason by Pink. I did have to turn the volume down on that one! On I went to country where I had to turn the volume down to 1/2 listening to Thats my Kind of Night by Luke Bryan. Great country sound, too! Finally, I wanted to try another one of my favorite old movie tunes: May it Be with Enya. Ahhh - so beautiful and peaceful. It was like I was watching the movie. I cant say enough about the sound on these headphones.Next, I tried a phone call. This took a bit of getting used to. I felt like I was talking in a tunnel because I couldnt hear myself that well. The other party heard me fine and I heard him fine, too; but I kept wanting to talk louder because of the tunnel effect. I think because they block out noises, its harder to hear yourself.As far as set up, I opened the box, plugged the headphones into the case and the case into the outlet. Couple hours later, I turned it on, QUICKLY synced to my iPHones bluetooth and began to listen. I dont understand why anyone would say these were difficult to set up.As for looks, yes they do stick out a bit more than usual if that bothers you. And, like other headsets, they can be a bit uncomfortable after several hours of use. I have used many earplug type and they all can be uncomfortable after a while. The only way to stop this is to use earphone that cover your ears instead of stick in your ear, but that type wont work for exercising as they will fall off.OK, Im back listening to Enya. So peaceful. . ."}

She was impressed with the sound quality with these bluetooth compared to her old buds, and the ability to control calls etc. Very quick and easy to pair, less than a minute and she was good to go. Only con was with her long hair, it was like a rubber band on the back of her neck, snagging hair--she said it wasnt a problem and still way better than dealing non wireless."}

I use them for weight lifting several times a week for a few hours at a time. I was a bit worried that these would not stay in place while moving around but I can not shake them loose. Putting than on you can feel them grip your ear but the remain comfortable. I them can shake my head with all my might and they stay put.As far as sound they are a very noticeable upgrade. When the music started I could not believe how clear and loud they were. I thought my 906s were good but these blow them away. They are also very isolating. They are much like wearing earplugs and keep out the gym noise and terrible gym music very well.I really liked how easy they were to start using. When you turn them on for the first time they pair with your device and your ready to go. The cord is also a good length and the buttons are a good size making them easy to negotiate.UPDATE:I got these in Aug, its now Dec.I still love them. They have been performing well and have really made an improvement in the gym. The only thing I can say bad is the battery just makes it for me. Im a total gym rat and can have some long workouts. They have never run dead but I have completed workouts with them announcing they are low on power. For most people this will probably not be an issue but I do wish they last a bit longer. Still feel great and blocks out the background noise amazingly. The charge pack is also very handy and really makes the system work. Without it I would not be as happy. Its a great combo."}

But his product has been lasting very long with trusted reliability.Now after 3-1/2 years, though my iPhone has been upgraded from 3GS to 4S, I am still happy with the holster and I went abroad with them several times with confidence.

{"id": 767, "text": "I plan to do a follow up to this review with much more detail, but this is a great universal backup for any phone or tablet, without question.One minor drawback, this unit doesnt actually come with a 120V AC to 5V DC (USB) charger, but those are easy enough to appropriate.  Personally, I would recommend a charger with 2 amps output since the battery will draw one amp to charge, and thats a fairly common adapter to find.  For example:Samsung OEM 2.0 Amp Travel Charger with Detachable Micro USB Cable for Samsung Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note 2 II, Galaxy S3 S III, Galaxy S3 Mini & Other SmartphonesAnything less than 1.2 amps output is going to be tasked so close to its maximum rating that you run a higher risk of damaging the charger.The biggest drawback is the charging time, which is going to take 7-8 hours when you drain the battery to 25% or less. Thats simply because the capacity on this pack is so high that it takes longer to recharge.  This is only a drawback and not a flaw that the manufacturer should pay for in rating points: I love this battery.I cant do any more justice to the specs than others have already done, but I can try to illustrate the performance.  I had this in my backpack for about a week after charging, before its first use.  I know for a fact that all batteries (especially rechargeable) have a trickle discharge when not in use, so realistically it was not at 100% when used.  My Note II (stock battery) was still able to completely charge the first time from ~40% phone battery, and a second time several days later from ~30% phone battery.  And the New Trent battery pack still had juice left to spare (albeit low) after both uses and no charging for two weeks!Right now, its going for $30 and I may purchase a couple more as gifts.  These are fantastic.  You never know when you may need one and they take up as much space as a cell phone.  The performance is there, and for this price you cant go wrong.  Definitely recommend this to others with confidence."}

{"id": 777, "text": "These Apple adapters have been around forever - in one version or another, although they all look the same - and there are now many adapters that do similar things for less money. That said, these truly do just work with Macs, and they provide a quick and easy way to add extra Ethernet ports to any Mac with a spare USB port.You can attach as many of these as you have free USB ports, and youll gain that many Ethernet ports, although speed is going to go from marginal (10/100) to worse (10/100 spread over numerous ports) once the USB controller gets saturated.If you have a computer which isnt a Mac, buy a different adapter - itll be cheaper. If you have a newer Mac and dont need more than one additional Ethernet port, get the Thunderbolt version since its much faster. Otherwise, or if you want to add even more ports, get this. Its reasonably small, not unattractive, and fully functional without issue."}

{"id": 796, "text": "I really love this case. I like the feel of it, the size (width) of it, and the color. It seems like it was precision molded for iphone 4/4Ss. Its nearly perfect! Nearly. The only problem I have with it is that you cannot plug in most 3.5mm jacks into the phone with this case on. Apple earbuds work fine with this and just about most headphones that have a vertical jack (as opposed to an L-shape plug). But it really comes down to the diameter of your headphones jack. We all have apple earbuds lying around somewhere. If you dont, borrow a friends! Heres the test: take your favorite earbuds/headphones that you will be doing most listening on and compare the jack (part you plug in) with that of the Apple earbuds. Now do not compare the metal tips! These are the same for all 3.5mm headphones/buds out there. You want to compare the plastic/rubber/latex, etc. that surrounds part of that metal piece. On the Apple earbuds its that plastic cylinder looking part that the metal tip sticks out from. Now if your headphone/buds are wider than the Apple ones, chances are they will not fit through the case and you will have to tediously take your phone out of your case just to plug in. One solution I tried was widening the headphone jack hole in the case, but not too much so that the case would still be strong and not tear at that point. High tech, you take a dremel or sanding attachment and make minute changes. A little sanding goes a long way. Low tech, get some sand paper and slowly work your way to widening that hole. But the case is great and I love it aside from that!"}

{"id": 807, "text": "Purchased from On The Go solutions, and have filed for a return or replacement.  Ill update this review with the results of my return process.  First the reasons why Im returning the phone:- The phone keeps dropping cell service.  Zero bars, and the message No Service appears.  Toggling airplane mode, manually searching for networks, rebooting, and reboot with battery pull all do nothing.  Then mysteriously it will start working again for a while, with full bars (which is the normal condition for T-Mobile from my home and work).  Reviews online dont suggest this is a common problem for this phone; it just appears defective.- Volume down button sticks.  I kept noticing that the phone was always on vibrate only.  Then one time I rebooted it and the phone started up in ODIN recovery mode (which is power+volume-down).  If I tap a few times on the volume down I can unstick it, but it will stick again later.  Reviews online suggest this phone is somewhat susceptible to button failures, probably from use over time.- The phone was not new as advertised by the seller.  The box did have an unbroken Samsung seal, but that seal had been placed *over* an original seal that had been broken.  I suspect this is a refurbished phone, and Im disappointed that the seller was not careful enough to accurate list the product.  Im not sure a used 2+ year old phone with no warranty is worth $250.I do like this phone model.  Here are my favorite features:- Data on T-Mobile 4G is very fast, at least compared to my older 3G phone.- Battery life seems to be good.  Minimal use but push e-mail nets me about 18 hours or so between charges.- Uses a mini-SIM card (this the earlier SIM form factor, larger than the micro-SIM most smart phones are now using).  This way I can use my older phone as a backup (same SIM card form factor).- Screen is gorgeous- Processor is zippy; no lags in the UI to my eye.- Google supports this phone with Android 4.3.- I have a friend who purchased one of these when it first came out and it has been rock solid for him over the years.There were a few downsides to this phone that I perceive to be design issues and not endemic to this particular phone:- Call quality is OK, but I heard some echo a few times, and so did a caller, once.- Loudspeaker volume is weak enough to be somewhat unusable.  My old Galaxy S is significantly louder.I like this phone model, and hope the seller is able to replace this defective one with a truly new one as advertised.UPDATE: 09/18/2013Im late updating this review.  The seller, On The Go Solutions, was responsive.  I asked for a replaecment, but in new condition as advertised.  They accepted the return and promptly refunded my purchase price, indicating that they currently had no stock of the phone."}

I dont see how it can be repaired so I am left with a piece of trash or trying to fix it myself.  To be clear, the case connector is simply a bad design (weak).  I had blackberry cases for many years on my hip without a single issue like this .  I wish I could find a blackberry case  that would fit the mophie.  The other problem I had was the phone and case combo was heavy enough to pull the phone off your hip unless it is on your belt.  Clipping it to your pocket on khakis would fall off 100% of the time.

Was just as pictured.Cons- Case is extremely slippery. If you want protection, this is not the case to get. I do not see this case helping at all if the phone is dropped."}

{"id": 934, "text": "This is one of the best little gadgets I own! I wasnt sure if this would work with my Trident Aegis case, but sure enough, it does. So one thing to note about it, is that it does warm a little at times if the battery is really low and it has to charge up a bunch. However, the level of heat is really nothing to warrant any concern or even raise any eyebrows, simply making the case warm to the touch. I would assume that underneath the case, that the phone itself is probably warmer, but as we all know, any device warms when charging. Just saying that you might notice a bit of warmth when you pick it up.There is a slight few seconds of delay when you first place the phone onto the plate before it registers the device and starts charging, maybe 1-2 seconds at most, then youre all good to go, so dont be alarmed if it doesnt recognize the phone as soon as you place it down on the plate.  One thing to note that it seems to go into a dormant, or sleep mode when it doesnt have a device on it, so you dont have to worry about it continually draining power (for those of a &#34;greener state of mind&#34;). Charges as well as if my device was plugged in as near as I can tell.  Ive been using this charger for a little over a week now, and couldnt be happier with it.

A razor blade or other relatively sharp, thin metal tool is useful and highly recommended in many of the instructional videos.While I didnt find it difficult to replace the screen, you MUST watch at least a few of the instructional videos on YouTube.  If this repair isnt done very carefully, you will break your iPod, for example, WiFi wont pick up signals or the power button wont work.* I say this was easy to install, but Im mechanically inclined.  If you arent, pay someone to make the repair.  It takes a very steady and precise hand and patience.PROS:* Good quality screen* Most tools needed are includedCONS:* Missing thin metal pry bar (I, very carefully, used a razor blade)* Could use adhesive strips (I used double sided tape)* No USB cable included, even though its in the picture.  (I wasnt expecting it)I would buy this product again."}

{"id": 947, "text": "Ive always been a no-case or minimal-case type of person. Since it was available, Ive used the Caze thinnest case in the world and it served me well until it got scratched almost to pieces.I liked this case, initially, because it looks like an iPhone 5 without the logos so it has a very minimal-esque overall look. The rubber/plastic body case is very sturdy and doesnt seem to have much give which gives it a snug fit over the perimeter of the case, the volume buttons, and the power button.The mute slider is a bit hard to reach since the case does add a bit of bulk. The aluminium frame (color varying item) is awesome. It has a smooth finish and doesnt seem to want to scuff or scratch very easily. My phone is almost always in my pocket or face up on some kind of soft surface (sunglasses/screen cleaners are the best) so I dont anticipate having a lot of wear as other customers have noted. Im definitely going to order another color or two.The only reason I docked a star is because of the added bulk. Although I wasnt surprised by it (a tad thinner than an Otterbox Commuter) I do find myself shifting the phone in my pocket a little more often.This is an awesome case and Id recommend it for minimalist fans, stock-look fans, and those who like to change their case every so often - this provides a great mix of style and (minor) customization."}

{"id": 949, "text": "As the title describes, I bought this product skeptically. It was meant to be used for my Galaxy Nexus 4 during my Hawaii vacations. You know, a $10 product to be used to waterproof my $350 cellphone.Lets start with the review.Shipping - The item was delivered faster than expected and arrived in excellent conditionFirst Impression - When opened the package, saw a good quality product. First thing I made was to check the plastic quality, the locking system and the neck strap. The clear plastic looked clear enough and the locking system convincible.Tests - Well, before sending my phone in to the snorkeling trip, I decided to give the case a simple test. I inserted a few napkins inside of it and submerged on a bath tub. The result? Napkins came out completely dry. But as you may be thinking, thats not comparable to an open sea snorkeling day. So I tried the same napkin test in a beach near my house. Again, napkins came out dry.Snorkeling Trip - So came the day. I was on a Snorkeling trip in Molokini Crater, Maui. Still worried, inserted my phone into the case and jumped into the water. The phone still looked dry. After 3 hours of snorkeling, in/out sea water, the phone was still dry. So after all, the $10 case delivered.Usage Tips - First of all, be sure that you put the phone in Camera mode before entering the water. Sometimes handling the phone underwater turns funny. Also remember your phone buttons, you dont want to spend the whole trip looking for the camera button in the screen. Also make sure that you lock the case while getting most of the air outside of it. If the case is locked and theres air inside, handling the phone is not easy. Also those air bubbles seemed to affect the phone focusing while underwater.Cons - My only cons of the product is the neck strap. The lower part of it is made of a really thin cord that I decided to remove before jumping into the water. It did not looked confident or break proof, even proving that my device floated with the case.To recap: even when I faced a few issues with air bubbles, out of focus videos/pictures, I managed to notice them and &#34;fix it&#34;. So after the first real try the pictures and video got really good. My pictures were so good that friends thought they came from a camera with a hard case.Believe me, dont get fooled by the price. My unit exceeded my expectations."}

It fits perfectly, the cut outs are exactly the right shape and size and it just feels like a quality case.

The fit right over top of the phone button and have a really good solid feel when you press them. I actually like the way the buttons work better with the case on than when the phone is naked. I liked this case so much I bought one for my fathers Galaxy S3 as well.My personal recommendation is; If you have a phone that they make this case for, buy it. It will protect your phone and it looks really nice."}

{"id": 961, "text": "I must have the new improved model because most of the cons listed in other reviews are simply not true for the telephone model.  There IS rubber on the bottom and cradle areas.  It does not slide.  The only problem that may occur in the future could be the hinge in one area because, with repeated bending, it may break.  I have seen no sign of any problems so far (no whitening of plastic).  I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I keep it on this stand when charging.  Since the charger plugs in at the bottom I just turn the phone on its side for charging.It folds up very nicely to make a small, flat package.  It clicks into a locked position so there is no danger of it coming unfolded and, therefore, getting broken in your briefcase, etc.I plan to order another one.

White becomes speckles of red green and blue.  It isnt horrendously bad, but its quite a significant trade off."}
{"id": 967, "text": "The Sharkk 10,000mAh battery is perhaps one of the best portable battery packs Ive had the pleasure of reviewing. The battery itself features a very solid outer shell, dual USB ports (both 1A and 2.1A outputs), an embedded micro USB charging cable, a micro USB charging port, and LED indicators.This battery pack takes hours to charge, but lasts a very long time. Doing some simple math, I should be able to charge my iPhone 4S just under 7 times (10,000 / 1,432 = 6.98). From my testing, I was able to charge my iPhone around 6 times. Even though this is 1 charge less than the theoretical amount, its definitely not worth complaining about considering its price. Under light to moderate usage, 6 complete iPhone cycles should last more than a few days, which is well more than enough time to find a power outlet or USB port to charge your device. Seeing that you can also charge tablets with this battery pack, you should be able to extend your battery life on those devices by a decent bit.Overall, this is a great battery pack. For $24.99, its definitely one of the best battery packs Ive ever reviewed. Combining solid build quality with high capacity and affordability, Sharkk really hit the nail on the head with this one, and Id definitely recommend it for anyone who is on the go and doesnt always have the time to sit tethered to a wall outlet, cigarette lighter, or computer to charge their mobile devices.I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation."}

Becomes a real pain to reset it and lose everything but a locking phone is huge must for me. I realize I can put a password and such but the dock should not be doing this to my phone.

{"id": 986, "text": "When I first looked at this battery pack I was reminded something techy from the 70s. It has square edges and brushed metal accents. I was also taken aback at how big and heavy it was. I was thinking, really, there are more compact and sleek designs than this. But then, I started charging things. I used it exclusively to charge my Droid Incredible 4G LTE for a week. And the battery pack was still at 75% power. Wow. That would have drained most battery packs to nothing. I used it to charge a Kindle fire, same slow drain with little impact on the amount of juice left in my heavy metal brick. It did not charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet.It comes with two cables, one shorter, one longer and four plugs including micro USB, mini USB, iPod (30-pin) and PSP. Or you can use your own USB device cable.What I like: HUGE power capacity. Love the battery remaining percentage. It gives you a clear indication of how much battery is left. It charges two devices at a time.What I dont like: it is heavy and big. I would be a lot to take for a long airplane trip although the benefit is that you dont have to carry a couple of smaller banks. It does not have a carry case to keep all the parts together. The box says it has a built-in flashlight but it does not have one. However, I couldnt imagine carrying this around to use as a flashlight.For the price, this beast packs a ton of power. If you need longevity, this is the device to go with. If you want portability and moderate use, there are other smaller power-banks.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review."}

This one was rather difficult to remove all the bubbles and to get to lay flat. After getting it on properly looks decent enough. The anti glare is not a true anti glare. Still reflects off the sun a good bit but better than no screen protector. I do not believe this is anti fingerprint by any means. First time touching it there are finger prints all over the screen, quite disappointed about that. After a week of normal average use there has been a pin hole in the screen protector. The phone ever only goes in my pocket. (I am a male so the pockets are normal size, not female sized pockets. So now I have a bubble in the middle of the screen with a tiny hole in it.  Guess that is why they give you three covers.  Overall okay product. Would not buy again though."}

{"id": 1000, "text": "After using this device on numerous occasions, Im lukewarm about it. It has some nice things about it, but also some annoying things -- and at this price point, its just not that impressive. See below --PROS:+ super compact and lightweight+ auto-power on/off+ nifty little charging station enables portable charging and provides a nice base, making it harder to lose+ pairing is easy+ cNEUTRAL:0 Volume is okay, nothing specialCONS:- battery life is around an hour and a half on a charge... works okay for a single convo, not good for a business conference or long car trip. I understand you can easily plug it in and charge it back up, which is fine if Im making short calls... but the battery life is so short that it limits applicability. The people paying premium prices for this are probably expecting a bit more- audio is awful on my Galaxy SIII. Every time Ive connected, theres a faint but audible whine/crackle that doesnt go away. I thought it might just be interference from something in my house, but it did the same thing in my yard and in my car. For me, the audio alone is a deal breaker... but its possible this could be a bad unit, or simply not happy pairing with my particular phone. I doubt it though since many other Bluetooth devices have been perfectly happy pairing with my phone.OVERALL:Im giving this two stars. This device has a couple neat things going for it, but the market is full of nifty Bluetooth headsets and has been for years. There are plenty of other options out there that are just as portable, but cheaper, with better battery life, and without the annoying audio issues I experienced. All in all, I cant really recommend this."}
{"id": 1001, "text": "The headset is of interesting design and comfortable, but suffers from several flaws on battery life and audio quality -- especially at this price point. A cheaper Plantronics model I used a number of years ago works much better than this headset. I even updated the firmware to see if any of the shortcomings would be fixed -- nope.Looks: Sleek and discreet, but only works on your right ear. Very lightweight and comfortable when worn. Packaging is very wasteful and makes it difficult to remove the product -- I almost thought Id break it when I was unboxing. But looks are deceiving, and the small size drastically reduces the battery life...Battery life/charging: Terrible. Despite the promises of two hours (yes, just 2) of talk time per charge I typically only get a single hour before hearing the low battery remark spoken in my ear. Then I have to find the charging base to recharge (and if the base is out of charge, plug that into another USB charger.) Way too many parts to remember. The 10 hour advertised talk time is really charging it four more times in the base, which does use a standard micro USB cable to charge (a short version and an AC adapter is included.) You can press the single button on the headset to hear the remaining battery life if desired at any time.Audio quality: incoming sound can be garbled (digital noise) even when the phone is just a couple feet away. When walking outside, despite the space age microphone being built into the headset without a boom, it doesnt pick up my voice well on a windy day outside on the sidewalk. Oh, and I tried to say answer to have it pick up a call and it never responded -- so much for the included voice recognition.Operation: There is no on/off switch on the headset -- if its out of the base, its on. Thats great for simplicity; no so great if the base isnt nearby and you want to turn the headset off. Theres also a slight hiss in the earpiece when youre not on a phone call. Pairing and volume control (via touch slider) is dead easy though if thats any consolation. I dont have an NFC-enabled device, nonetheless, pairing was still simple with my iPhone 5 and took seconds.Overall: Not worth the premium price. Plenty of decent options available for half the asking of this model. Id only stick with this headset if I only talked on the phone 30 minutes a day, stayed inside, and really really cared about looks or weight of the unit."}
{"id": 1002, "text": "There are number of things I really like about this headset, but the issue that knocked off stars and will likely reduce my usage of this is that the microphone delivers sound quality that is barely fair.  People could hear me, but it sounded like I was in a hole.  When I switched Bluetooth headsets, the statement was always ahhh, thats MUCH better.  Whereupon I would be clearly reminded how much stress a poorly functioning microphone introduces into the conversation.I use headsets a LOT.  Work and personal life.  I will spend almost anything to get a good headset with the basic features I want... #1 clear microphone, #2 NO pocket re-dialing, #3 Clear and load speaker to hear the other person.So, the stone gets a C for microphone quality (#1 feature).  Storing the headset in the stone item to recharge also turns it off, so no accidental redials (#2 feature, bane of my existence with the Bluetooth headsets).  The sound from the speaker is pretty good for this little headset, Id give that an A (#3 feature)Fit: The Stone is convenient and easy to use.  Fit on my ear was ok, but not snug, so moving about could cause it to come loose.Battery:  The talk time of 2 hrs between charges (charge by placing it back into the stone to recharge), is most definitely a problem if you use this for work or speak on calls with people for hours at a time (catching up with friends out of town, etc.).  What surprised me was how quickly the headset would go from 50% charge (1 hr) to 90-100% charge (2 hrs) in the little re-charger... I didnt measure it but it seemed to be 10-15 mins.One very irksome point... I cannot fathom why USB re-charging cable for this is only 6 inches long.  I do not have plugs up on my desk.

{"id": 1004, "text": "*Disclosure: I was contacted by ZeroLemon and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it.*My own S4s battery is pretty much new, so making a comparison between the ZeroLemon and the original battery was a snap. The fit and finish of the ZeroLemon is good if generic in appearance, drops right into place inside my phone. Following the directions given, I sped through the power cycling as quickly as possible. Im hard pressed to find a difference between this replacement battery and the original. Run times are slightly better as would be expected with the somewhat marginal difference in capacity.  At best, I got an extra 2.25hrs out of the extended battery, at worst just over 1 hour. I ran trials both specifically to drain the battery and in every day usage. A pity about the lack of NFC, but if that isnt something you use, then the loss is meaningless.  Given the price (nine bones at the time of this writing) and warranty, I think the ZeroLemon battery is a pretty good deal compared to the competition."}

With little use during the day the battery seems to last about 10% longer than the stock battery, but with any moderate to regular use, I found this battery draining as quickly as stock. For 400 ma more, I would have hoped for a little more battery life.Update: 8/30/13Okay, Ive been using this exclusively, but decided to go back to the stock S4 battery and was surprised to see how much longer the stock battery lasted. Im not sure what happened but the stock battery is definitely outlasting this one with 400 ma more. So its back to stock for me."}

It has indicator lights for each USB port and is a solid design.

I really like how it has a special higher powered USB port for devices like the iPad so they charge quicker.The battery itself has a nice rubberized coating. I charged an iPad with it and it drained almost all of the battery, so it doesnt have enough power to get a second charge out of it. However, it still had enough power to run the flashlight. Yes, it has a flashlight, which is a great feature for power outages. It isnt a powerful light, but good in a pinch.If you are buying this for the wrist cable, forget about it. It is awful. The hole is too small. It took me ten minutes to get the strap through the hole and it was ruined by that point. Once I finally got it through the cable itself came undone from the plastic clasp that holds it together.For the price it would have been nice to have included a charger with the battery. Yes, it can be charged with any charger or computer with a USB cable, but an included charger would have been nice."}

It is clear with minimal picture lossCons: My finger doesnt slide as well over this protector as it did with products from Realook.  I probably should of just paid the 13 dollars to Realook in hindsight.  Also it isnt edge to edge protection.  If my phone wasnt in a case, I would be upset that this cover didnt go edge to edge even more.All in all the screen protector is doing what it is meant to do, but there are better products out there.  They will all make you lose some minute amount of picture quality, but the glossiness to be able to slide your finger will differ between them all.  I would rate this product a 3.5 due to the fact of the slight resistance to finger sliding and the lack of edge to edge protection."}
{"id": 1010, "text": "Its very elegant in its simplicity, but surprisingly well thought out.Plug your phone/tablet into the USB ports and charge it.  Simple power indicator.  Use your phone adapter (micro usb) or any USB port to charge it.  Small, lightweight, simple.What sets this apart from many charging devices is how it handles high power devices.  USB by standard is limited to 500mA, which isnt enough for most modern devices to charge quickly.  Early usb chargers signaled support for 1A power by wiring the two USB data pins together.  It became a defacto standard for the entire industry, the entire industry except Apple.  Apple instead decided to put a voltage on the data wires to indicate power.  Apple then extended this to have different voltages for different amperage to support their power hungry iPads.  A few others have had some of their devices adopt Apples way, but most still use the 1A defacto standard extension.  This device support both.  Natively it supports the Apple standard, so plug in any Apple cable and your Apple device will work at full power.  It also includes a micro-USB charging cable in the box.  Plug in this charging cable and your other devices will work at full power.The only downside is if you use a standard micro-USB cable instead of the included charging specific micro-USB cable your phone will charge slowly.  My Samsung Galaxy S II for instance charged at 740mA with the included cable, but only at 460mA with a standard cable.  Note that any Apple compatible charger will have this behavior, but most of them arent kind enough to include a special cable in the box for use with non-Apple devices."}
{"id": 1011, "text": "The new Philips Fidelio speaker is a surprisingly hefty portable speaker, weighing in at 2 1/4 lbs. Its attractive, and comes with a wall charger and cloth carrying case. The Philips syncs easily with our blue tooth devices and started working out of the box, thats the good news.The not so good news is the sound quality was muffled and the treble lacking, missing crisp higher notes. We played some Queen, some Hal Ketchum, and everything from Falling in Reverse to classical music. We missed the crisp clear notes and sound quality. Being older (sometimes with age higher notes are harder to hear), we called in our sons, who also noted the lack of treble clarity and mentioned the muffled sound.There is a USB port on the side to charge mobile phones (according to the directions) and allows the use of devices without bluetooth such as older Ipods. This ability to play older toothless (heh) devices is probably the best feature of the Philips Fidelio.The Philips also has a 3.5mm audio in jack. This allows the use of old computers without USB, well, my husband and I are racking our brains to think of something else this could be used for. So I did a search and came up with audio cassette players. With an adapter it also seems the speaker could be used for an electric guitar, or keyboard. But the sound quality would be lacking.Its strongest feature is its compatibility with a plethora of device"}

It is ideal for anyone who needs security for holding the device for long periods of time.This strap would be a great accessory for the jogger/runner because the wallet can fit your ID and keys and the strap will stay in your hand even if your grip loosens a little.

This is a good one."}

I did not promise them a good review and they did not ask for one in exchange.This iFLASH may be small but at 4400 mAh it carries enough juice to fully power up an iPhone 5 (1,440 mAh) at least twice or a Galaxy S III (2,100 mAh) once with some left to spare - keep in mind that the energy transfer is not 100% efficient so dont expect three iPhone 5 charges. Small size and simplicity is what makes this model different and it can be your favorite battery pack for as long as your phone charges through a Micro USB port (or you can supply your own wire) and you supply your own wall charger.It does come with essential accessories: a charging cable that can be used to either charge your phone and charge it and a nice bluish nylon mesh bag to hold the iFLASH and the USB wire. Besides its ability to charge a phone once you plug it in - and do NOT attempt to use it with anything larger such as a tablet - the only other features are a blue-LEDs charge meter that activates once you press the one white button once and a one-LED flashlight capability that turns itself on or off if you double-tap the white button.I am very found of this model and cant think of any negatives other than the shiny white finish being a fingerprint magnet but I dont know anyone who would spend much time staring at a battery pack.

It does help to make sure that you are wearing the right size ear buds. I found the smallest size to give me the best fit. My one complaint is that they didnt stay in my ears very well. The kept falling out. Maybe I just have crazy shaped ear canals, but I could be sitting on the couch and one of them would just pop out. I dont think I would feel comfortable running in them, but thats just my own personal experience.They do stick out of your ears quite a bit (theyre not as subtle as the kind that just nest inside your ear (i.e. the kind that come with apple products). I felt like I looked a little silly wearing them, since they are a little more obvious, but they do provide great sound and even some noise-reduction. I had them in when I was washing my hands and I couldnt even hear the water running.I like that the headset can connect with up to 8 devices. That way I can easily switch back and forth between my phone and my tablet. I found the ability to control the volume using the little buttons to be helpful. I also liked that I could switch between tracks using them as well. They do take a couple of hours to charge up (I think thats where the new version with the carrying case has an advantage). I thought they held the charge fairly well. They go into a deep sleep mode when youre away from your devices so that it doesnt drain your battery. I still needed to charge them every few days.All in all, I was pleased with the sound and usability of this headset. I like that I can even make and receive phone calls at the same time. Theyre pretty versatile. I could walk around my house and still hear my music, although if I walked down the hall, the sounds started to cut out. If youre in the same room as your device you shouldnt have any trouble though."}

It actually fell from my pack and fell several feet through dirty and mud and it still worked. The latch seal over the USB kept the ports from getting any water/dirt damage.

It works in charging my tablet (android and ipad), my android phone, my apple ipods, and even my camera battery if you have a usb charger. Also it is great to store in your bag with no fear of the battery becoming damaged. It is however a little bulky and can be heavy, so if youre looking for something smaller i recommend NEW TRENTS other batteries. They do have smaller size batteries.

{"id": 1074, "text": "Bought this for a little over three and a half bucks from amazon third-party marketplace seller GearCell. Looks nice but the inside of the chrome circle for the logo was chipped a bit with missing tiny chunks of plastic on the inside of that logo circle that you would notice if you really looked at it. So its like a bit of bad luck as to the case that was sent to me.  Sent a message to the seller to complain about this, but otherwise the sale was great in terms of price and had quick shipping, yet turned out to not be the best item out of whatever inventory the seller has. Nonetheless, started using this case on my iPhone because otherwise the case did look nice.However, after only a few days of use, could see that the rest of the chrome on the outside of the logo circle, and also on the thin horizontal chrome bars to the left and the right of the logo circle, were starting to have tiny bits of the chrome coating come off.  Not good. The rest of the case was fine, but the chrome trim was probably going to all come off over a period of time.Recommendation: Only get this if you dont want to spend more than five bucks.  If you are willing to spend more, go get theElago S4 Slim Fit Casewhich is similar, but is better without the fancy fake chrome trim.P.S.  Also be aware that you will get washed out pictures when use the flash when using the camera with this case on.  If you dont take any flash pictures, then you wont notice a problem.  However, if you plan to take pictures with the flash, like at night or in dark places, then take this case off your iPhone."}

You couldnt even tell the screen cover was on it ( I had some practice at this type of application with motorcycle armor for my saddle bags ).  Definitely follow the instructions and if its not perfect the first time, start over.  wash your hands first and spray your fingers before you touch the cover.One thing I will say is that this shield eliminated finger prints!  Since I use the visual pattern lock screen, the fingerprint hiding alone is worth the $10 to hide my screen unlock pattern."}

{"id": 1087, "text": "I have used this phone on the Sprint network for the past 21 months.Twenty-one months of frustration with Sprint service is enough. I am very excited that I can fire Sprint in three short months.Ten months ago I bought an iPad mini from Verizon. I carry both devices. I frequently get messages on the iPad ten minutes before the iPhone. Sprints data service is so spotty, even text messages and voice mail are delayed. It can often be longer, but a ten minute delay is typical (visual voice mail and Apple messaging).I can never rely on having a solid data connection. When traveling in rural areas, data is impossible to find. In many of the same areas, I get strong 4G or 3G on the Verizon iPad. Owning both devices clearly illustrates how inept the Sprint network really is. Even in a metro with 500,000 people, I frequently am forced to find a wifi hot spot in order to use the web to get data or files for my work if I dont carry the iPad.Sprint is weak in cities, and useless in rural areas and small towns. I travel frequently for business and I regret my Sprint purchase daily. Unlimited data is not a value if you cannot access it.The 4S is a good device. If you are considering the 4S, I definitely dont recommend it on Sprint. I would trade my iPhone on Sprint in a heartbeat for the klunkiest phone n Verizon because the phone is crippled by the Sprint network. If you are considering the 4S on a different network, I highly recommend spending a bit more for a 4G device. 4G networks are ten times faster, even on reliable networks. A positive smartphone experience is dependent on good data service.In 2013, the 4S is beyond obsolete because of the 3G data service. A 3G-data iPhone 4S on Sprint is so crippled that I would only recommend it if the person has constant wifi access. If you do have constant wifi access, an iPod touch is all you need. This phone on Sprint is obsolete and is not really a good choice for anyone."}

I for one, like to have the bulky feel to case covers because it assures me that it is protected and has a shock absorber that all phones need.When I bought my S3 I immediately bought the ballistic.  I was very excited to receive the case but to my surprise it wasnt as bulky as the iphone ballistics.  I was really disappointed and felt let down.  To this day I do not feel as if my phone has the protection it needs.  S3s/S4s are a lot more delicate that the iphone so I would assume ballistics would make their products with a little more protection for them.  It is thinner and really slippery; I feel like, at times, it will slip right out of my hands.I am not pleased with the product but I will put my trust in it that it WILL protect my phone.  I have not dropped my phone but since I do not feel as secure with the ballistic I am a lot more aware of how I handle my phone.

{"id": 1110, "text": "When I bought the Samsung Galaxy S3 back in 05/23/13 the first thing I did was come here to Amazon to find a good case for it. When you spend the amount of money that I did when I bought it you tend to want to protect it as well as you possibly can. Ive purchased several different phone cases in the past and most I bought right here on Amazon. When I found the Urban Armor Gear case I was drawn to it by the way it looked. It gave my S3 a more bold, Manly look that it didnt have. and after reading several reviews I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I received it pretty quickly, even faster than estimated time given by the seller. Well its been a few months now and the only time my phone comes out of its Urban Armor Gear case is when I need to change the battery. Ive dropped my phone on several occasions and to this Fay I dont have one scratch, crack, or one broken part on my phone. Thats gotta say something by itself. The case goes on and off with ease. all the buttons lined up perfectly and work without any issues at all. I dont use a screen protector because Samsung claims I dont need one and I have to agree with them on that. I dont have any scratches on my screen at all and after the abuse I put my phone through I should have many. I did try a couple at first but all they did was make my screen look like shit compared to it without one. I highly recommend Urban Armor Gear cases to anyone looking for a great looking functional case.&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;  UPDATE  09/27/13  &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;I I had to come back and just say a few more words about this case. 4-5 , months of constant abuse, dropped, knocked over and a lot of hard wear & tear and still looks Great and works Perfectly. I have decided I wont be look for any other cases The Urban Armor Gear case for my Galaxy S3  was and still is the only case Ill need.  I still highly recommend it to everyone."}

Once enclosed, the phone is protected very well.The outer material seems to be stiff, and hence it holds its shape well even when stuffed with cards like my wife usually does. Its easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth and colors are bright.

{"id": 1129, "text": "I have to say that this little guy packs quite a punch. I had an LG Lucid before this phone...six of them!!! That phone was terrible and showcased the worst of android software and hardware. I had software issues, charger port issues, wrong number issues, and screen problems that took their own toll. Bottom line: that was my first LG product and my last one PERIOD.Im sorry for that rant. That was just a horrible experience. Onto this phone.At first, I thought I was going to get the Galaxy Nexus, but they upgraded me to this phone because they were out of stock on the Nexus. This phone feels really nice in my hand. While Id want something high-end like a Note II, this phone made me realize how smaller devices are still very necessary for many users. Not only that, but this phone feels tough. I mean REALLY tough. I dropped this thing, caseless in a restroom and it didnt even get a dent or chip.  The screen, is really strong as well. I guess Gorilla Glass 2 makes a huge difference. The colors are nice and vibrant, though unrealistically a bit over saturated, but doesnt look bad by any means. The resolution may not be as high as people hope for, but this is the highest I had on a phone so far. Just remember, this is a budget phone.In terms of hardware, like I said this thing is solid. With this thing being water resistant (not waterproof), made out of aircraft Aluminum and Kevlar backing, and Gorilla Glass 2, you get incredible value for what you pay for. The camera is also nice. Nothing to write home about though. It can be hard to focus and the lighting Is a little hard. I dont know, maybe I need to play with the settings more, and perhaps even experiment with camera apps on Google Play. At least it takes pics pretty fast.For the internal hardware, you get a gig of ram, with the same 1.5 dual-core processor found on the Galaxy SIII. Pretty darn good for a midrange phone if you ask me. One thing that people may not be too thrilled about (and believe me, Im not either) is that while you get 8GB of storage, you only have 3.5 to 4GB to the user. I sort of half expected this, considering this is a budget phone. However, I have a bunch of apps installed and still have 1.5 free so I cant complain too much. Im not blaming the OS for the amount of storage it takes, but rather the amount of bloatware apps Verizon insists on having and cannot even remove. They really cant even take a hint that we dont want a lot of these apps. I dont mind the Amazon apps because I love Amazon, I like Kindle, and who wouldnt want a free app a day on their Appstore. I really could care less about the Audible app (but I might get into it someday), but what I dont want is the NFL, Zappos, and the annoying VZ Navigator, all of which you cant even uninstall. You can just disable them so they dont show, but then it just becomes dead space. Like it was to begin with. I do like the office suite you get on it though. You can install a 32 GB micro SD card for your music, pictures, videos, and whatever else you need on there, though I have heard of people going up to 64 GB, depending on the class. I have a 16 GB installed, but will probably get a 32 or 64. If my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet says it can go up to 32, but it can actually accept 64, then I might look into it for this phone. Also, the battery life is fantastic. Im a fairly heavy phone user with apps like youtube and Google Chrome, but it has gotten me through the morning to late evening, and even to the nexy day.Performance wise, this phone runs like a dream. Im not a hard core gamer on my phone, but Ive seen Dead Trigger running great on a YouTube review. I play a few games like Words With Friends,  the Tetris games from EA, maybe some other casual and retro platformers, and emulators. They all work very well on this phone.Software wise, it is running Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with MotoBlur on top. Youd think that Motorolas skin would be intrusive, but it really isnt all that bad. In fact, of all the custom skins put out by Samsung and HTC, this actually looks really close to stock, and to a lot of users, that is welcoming. I guess since Google acquired Motorola, they only let their costum UI only enhance stock Android. I like the Smartactions, but in all honesty, this is all stuff that you can do manually. Moreover, Google Now is on here, which is like iOSs Suri, but in a class of its own. I dont think youll be to disappointed in the accuracy of the voice recognition. After all, this company has been building on this foundation for years since before Suri was even born. I do like the circles widget. Its very handy, but I wish it was more transparent so it doesnt block so much of my wallpaper.Call quality is good on this phone.  The people I talked to sounded clear, but they said I sounded a bit fuzzy. The speaker is pretty good too, even for music and videos. When I connect my Skullcanfd headphones and earbuds, the sound was terrific.Here are some apps that I recommend for this phone specifically:Light Flow - good for customizing this phone s notification LED for specific apps like Facebook as this phone has multiple color lights supported, but cant be found in the phone settings. Theres a lite and paid version.Notification Light Widget - if your notification LED isnt on by default, you will need this. And it is actually made by Motorola. Rather than pushing an update to edit notification lights in the phone settings, they just made this widget instead.Notification Toggles - one thing I missed from the Lucid is that I could pull down the notification bar and have quick settings to tap like screen brightness and data on/off. This phone has no such fair, but with this, you can and then some.Conclusion:Overall, despite some flaws, this is a great phone for the price. The hardware and software is really good for the price and the screen is just the right size. If you get a Verizon salesman pushing another phone like either of the LG Lucids or Samsung Stratospheres, reject them and get this phone. This phone has had a lot of thought, care, and quality put into it, unlike those others Ive mentioned. I will update on the camera once I play with it more along with other areas of the phone.Update: so far, Im still rocking this phone very well and it hasnt had any scratches or dents at all. Im still taking experimenting with the camera as I havent had much of a chance to do so, but the pictures are good for the most part. Performance is still excellent overall. Still the best phone you can get at an affordable price!"}

{"id": 1131, "text": "Terrific combination of silicon and hard plastic so that the corners are well protected, yet with shock-absorbing silicon to protect the phone during drops.  Kickstand works well and the dual layer protection still results in a very slim overall package.  Would have given it 5 stars, however the belt clip is problematic.  When the phone is turned sideways on your belt, the clip protrudes beyond and above the edge of the phone and digs/cuts into your flesh (having a &#34;spare tire&#34; doesnt help, either, I admit).  The belt clip rotates180 degrees, but over the short span of a month, became a little loose from the case cover to which it is attached.  Not bad, just allows the phone to rotate a bit while on your belt.  The inside of the case cover is felt-lined, but over time a small protrusion of plastic is starting to push through the felt as the belt clip becomes more loosely attached.  It still wont touch the cell screen, but I wonder how much worse it will get.  Im just darn picky, though, and this is the slimmest yet most protective case Ive found....but they really need to redesign that belt clip."}

The only reason this doesnt get 5 stars is that even though its a really cool case, it doesnt have very good protection."}

It is as good or maybe even better than when I plug the headphone directly into my HTC ONE !!!For my usage (at sport) this is a great gadget. it allows me 3 training of 1.5 hours without worrying about charging.Sound is really great if coupled with a great headphone, there is no loss thanks to the Apt-x !Update : I removed 2 star: I am using it now for 4-5 months, average once a week...The range is unbearable, in a gym it will give you about 9 meter with no obstacle and just your body or one equipment will cut the signal.Also, I generally work out for 2 hours, the autonomy is less than 3 hours now...very bothering to charge it after each workout !!"}

{"id": 1138, "text": "****Heres why to buy this device.  You plug it -- the Belkin Car Charger 1 AMP / 5 Watts - Black -- into a 12-volt charging socket (nee lighter adaptor) in your car or your hot air balloon or your aircraft carrier, then you attach the not-supplied cable to connect it to your iPhone 5 or similarly connectible device in order to charge its battery.  Under normal circumstances this product works as advertised which is why I eventually subtract no more than one star.The rest of this review is about using it on the ISS (International Space Station), so if youre not interested in that then stop reading now.First, on the ISS there is no gravity.  As you will see if you read on for many more paragraphs, that eventually makes no difference.Second, on the ISS we receive supplies only once every very few weeks, and it costs about a gillion dollars per delivery.  Literally every extra gram counts.  The product under review, without cable, weighs 14 grams, which was just barely under NASAs limit.Third, I did receive in a delivery the product under review in a timely manner.  I dont know whether Amazon charges extra for deliveries to the ISS, but if so I know it never showed up on my bill.Fourth, the ISS is not wired to plug the product under review into.  We run 27.6 volts AC rated to 700 amps, which simply does not convert to 12 volts DC without a specialized adaptor that, as far as I know, is not available commercially.  For this I subtract 1 star, because I cant order pizza any more.****Oh, and the fact the package doesnt include a cable to fit either end.  Oh, and the fact there is no instruction manual whatsoever.  As a public service I will create the manual for you in case you want to know what it would say: (1) Find a cable that fits your phone on one end and the charger on the other.  (2) Plug in both ends.  (3) Plug the charger into the adaptor in your car or hot air balloon or aircraft carrier.  (4) Wait.  Not designed for use on the International Space Station.****"}

{"id": 1168, "text": "This is currently my go to case for my GS3. The brown suede is beautiful and you can really see the quality of the material. My problem lies with the chrome accents. In the beggining they looked great, elegant and a nice addition to break up the solid brown color of the case. After about 2 weeks the letters at the bottom began to peel. At the moment the bottom now reads for Gala S III, lost a few letters there. Even worse the top portion has a metal, aka chrome looking sticker accent that completely peeled off. That has become a bit of an eyesore.With all this being said this case is inexpensive and serves a purpose that I need fulfilled. The card holder is one of the slimmest ive owned (and ive owned a few) which is a big plus in my book. It still holds 3-4 cards comfortably, though I wouldnt go beyond that.The case fits snug and the majority of the phone is protected (top and bottom exposed). It also has less points for tear. My previous case was the brown retro style wallet flip case (here on amazon). This case literally fell apart within a few weeks. Aside from the accents (FIX THESE MODN!) this case has a solid build quality. Its a shame that the build quality of the case itself is tainted by the poor application of a few accents.Sidenote: The interior of this case is more orange than the picture depicts.Like my review?

I read one persons review of how the back was plastic and that it would break after a few uses well,THEY WERE NOT LYING!I purchased several portable chargers as gifts for friends and family on a recent trip abroad. I should have ordered them weeks in advance and tested them out as, several had flaws but, the customer service of the other devices was great.RAVPower was the one and only device I bought for myself rather than for anyone else. There was no manufacturing problem from what I can tell. Nothing was broken or did not work well.IMPORTANT TO NOTE:-It is a very quick draining device.-It is my opinion that you will not get a complete charge out of it no matter what you are told to do.-It turns off during charging quite frequently. I dont know if it is meant to do this or if it is a flaw.-From my experience, the plastic back is loose and very cheap. IT WILL BREAK or LOOSEN UP after a few usages causing the on and off lights to blink or simply turn off during use.-From what I have noticed and observed through using this, the flashlight is the ONLY good thing about this device.My recommendation:There are SEVERAL other devices out there which are superior. It is worth it to spend another 2-3 bucks on something better.Sorry RAVPower, I should have headed the advice of other reviewers."}

I popped the casing apart and found a wire loose and a very sloppy soldering job all the way around.  This sure was not machine soldered and I worry now about the types of people working on the bench. The battery was supposed to be secured with glue but it was sloppily applied and everywhere inside the case except the battery.Hope this manufacture can improve workmanship.

If youre like me you use your phone for everything; texting, phone calls, email, internet, music, videos, etc.  And lets say you do all those things in a continuous amount of time, youll be out of battery in about 2-3 hours.  Not a typical day for me, but a typical got nothing else to do day.  Belkins Grip Power Battery Case pulls through to give you nearly double the time you would have under your normal usage conditions.First off, case is easy to get on and off.  Not as complicated as those box cases.  There is no screen protector, but I like that.  They smudge, get bubbly, and sticky. The case extends out enough to protect the screen from a fall.  A rubber gripper outlines the case and the back looks and feels a little slippery, but if you grip it like a phone you will be fine.You can charge the case by itself or with the phone inside.  With the phone inside you can charge them together with the included Micro-USB charging cable (goodbye expensive iphone charger).  What I dont like about charging them together is that when you pull the cable out, the case goes into charging mode.  You have to be sure to shut it off or you wasted the charge.Activating the case to charge the phone is as easy as pushing a button.  The familiar charging tone can be heard and the phone charges back to 100% within an hour, sometimes faster.  The phone does tend to get a little hot while the case is charging it. Although it is white in color, the case does not attract dirt and grime."}

Even using my iPad 3rd gen charger, capable of charging at a 2.1A rate, the current draw was only 0.73A. I suspect the charging IC is just a linear lipo regulator so the charge current to the 18650 cells is 1:1 for the input current. If true, and if one goes by the advertised mAH rating of 2800, then at 0.73A charge, full charge takes 3.8 hours.Still a good price, and great for an emergency.  Just wish it had more mAH output and charged faster."}

I am very happy that I did not lose my unlimited plan during my upgrade.  If you do experience this issue, you need to contact AT&T.; For anyone with an older Blackberry, you can get paid for trading in your older Blackberry for a newer model. Check out the link below.[...]Switching devices is simple. There are apps that can be installed on iPhones and Android phones from [...] The same app can be downloaded from Blackberry World. There are multiple ways to move your data from an old Blackberry to the Blackberry Z10.The Blackberry Z10 is a great for business and leisure. The Blackberry Flow allows me to navigate smoothly and quickly in between tasks with one hand. It is easy to quickly minimize an app and start a new one. I can minimize the NFL Mobile app and open the StubHub app with my thumb. The Blackberry Hub is a centralized location for messages and is always easy to get to with one or two gestures. It is easy to switch between text messages, e-mails, calls, etc. from the hub. The smart keyboard and gestures help me quickly type what I need, so I can get back to performing other tasks. When typing, I do not need to press a button to switch between text and symbols. I can just swipe a finger up or down the keyboard. The words that the smart keyboard predicts are very accurate and easy to flick up into my sentences. Once you learn the right gestures, it is easy to delete multiple e-mails. When Im ready to lock my device, I can just press the power button at the top of the device and the screen provides me an option to lock the device.The browser is smooth and fast, especially in the 4G LTE areas. Adobe Flash and private browsing can be enabled in the browser. Video clips from any website can be viewed. The browser supports HTML5. I can open multiple tabs and save my favorite pages as bookmarks. The reader feature puts the text and graphics from the website in an enlarged and easy to read format. The best way to describe the reader feature is to say webpages are converted into a e-book format.  Google Maps is accessible through the browser.  It is easy to share webpages from the browser with the share icon, which is available from most screens on the Blackberry.I love the voice control feature on my Blackberry Z10. If I do not have time to look at the Blackberry and type, I can use the voice control feature to make a call, send an e-mail or text, schedule an appointment, search the internet and take notes.I love that the Blackberry Z10 has Near Field Communication (NFC). It was already easy to share information with the Blackberry Z10 via Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE), e-mail, text message, BBM, HDMI and Skype. I can also share files from my Blackberry Z10 by tapping another Blackberry 10 or any NFC enabled device. Unfortunately, you cannot tap and share with your friends that have the expensive iPhone 5S because the iPhone 5S does not have NFC.The Blackberry Z10 has a built-in screen shot feature, so there is no need to download a third party app. Capturing a screen shot on a BlackBerry Z10 device is simple as holding both the volume up and volume down buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until you hear a shutter sound. The screen shots will be saved in the camera picture gallery.The cameras are great. The Blackberry Z10 quickly takes beautiful pictures with either of the two cameras. The time shift mode allows me to find the best facial expression from those memorable moments. I enjoy using my Blackberry Z10 to Skype with family and friends. I like that I can switch between my two cameras during the Skype video call.The BlackberryZ10 is great for listening to the music stored on my Micro SD card.  Of course, I have albums from artist like Alicia Keys and Gyptian on my Blackberry.  I used my music on my media card to make my ringtones. My Blackberry Z10 can play music using earbuds or through any of my vehicles sound systems.  Blackberry Z10 has Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (BLE) with aptX(tm) enabled, so sound is exceptionally great via bluetooth.  I can also download TuneIn Radio from Blackberry World to listen to local and international radio stations from my Blackberry Z10.Parents will like that the Blackberry Z10 has built-in parental controls, so there is no need to download a third party app. Parents can set a password to access the parental controls, so that the children cannot change them. Phone and text messages can be limited to just the individuals in the contacts. Parental controls allow parents to turn off features like the camera and video, Facebook, Twitter, uploading to YouTube and purchase content just the name a few. Content restrictions can also be set.My Blackberry Z10 has many other security features. My Blackberry Z10 makes it easy to encrypt the data on my device and my Micro SD card. If my Blackberry Z10 is ever stolen, Blackberry Protect allows me to track or wipe my Blackberry from a remote location.The Adobe Reader app is great. It allows sharing via e-mail, BBM and NFC. I can navigate the PDF by using the bookmarks. I can zoom in and out of the text and images. I can even enter comments, signatures, highlight and strike through text and click hyperlinks. My changes are saved automatically upon exiting the document. It is great for conducting business on the go.  Blackberry 10 devices have a built-in zip file feature that allows me zip files, which is convenient when I need to attach multiple large files in an e-mail.The phone call quality is great on the Blackberry.  They phone has many features available from the phone app, such as dial pad, phone history, voicemail and contacts.  The dial pad has large keys and is available when I need to use it with an automated system.  It is easy to switch between phone, speaker and Bluetooth.  These options are available during the call.There are two minor things I think you should note. There was not a holster included with the Blackberry Z10, so you will need to purchase your own. The Password Keeper did not come with the OS, but it can be downloaded from Blackberry World.For the Blackberry Haters:Blackberry and Blackberry devices will be around for a long time. People counted Blackberry out before they really tested the new Blackberry 10 devices.  Blackberry is known for its security, which is probably why BlackBerry was awarded Authority to Operate on U.S. Department of Defense networks. Blackberry will retain its reputation for secure Blackberry devices and software for managing and securing mobile devices. Do not go to sleep on Blackberry. In the future, Blackberry may provide means for the auto industry to manage car software.[...][...][...][...][...][...][...][...]It is funny people complain that Blackberry does not have enough apps. Consumers have to be aware that some smartphone companies are not just trying make money selling their expensive smartphones, but also their apps and services.[...]"}

My second was from FGS Trading and was genuine.Insist that the phone you buy is factory sealed in the box, and watch the YouTube videos on how to spot the fakes.Lastly, read the seller reviews. REvans065 had a 100% positive rating when I purchased from him, he now has almost 70% negative as hes selling counterfeit phones. Even Amazon isnt a totally safe place to buy, although the return policy does protect you. If the Fulfilled by Amazon option is available, use it. I saved $10 on the purchase price and then wasted 2 weeks of my time and $15 sending a counterfeit phone back and getting a refund.You have been warned."}

Separate from the apps that you can download all the features will keep you happy, satisfied, contented, busy, entertained for daaaaaaayyyyys.  Its slim too and fits very well in the hand one or both.  Typing is good too, a little bigger than the S3 but you dont really notice it.  ITS VERY FAST TOO ABSOLUTELY NO DRAG.

{"id": 1209, "text": "Overall a very good speaker except for its lack of bass. Includes a charging cable and a 3.5mm audio cable, which comes in handy. The speaker is meant to be very portable, and it is exactly that. I wouldnt call it pocket-sized, but I could certainly fit it in my pocket and take it with me if I wanted to. I keep it stored in my backpack when I am on the go. The base of it is plastic, but the top and side is metal. The speaker feels very durable and I would not be concerned if I dropped it.Battery Life:The device was shipped fully charged. I ran it for about thirty minutes on Bluetooth, and since then I have been running it on an aux cable. I have been using it for two days, more than twenty hours so far. I have not had to recharge the battery on it yet. The battery life on this device is great!Sound Quality:It sounds good, but not great. It has almost no bass at all. It is not very loud; I would not use it for a party. For listening to music around my apartment it does the job well. I havent noticed any static with Bluetooth or the Aux cable. Sound quality is the only downside of this device. Again, it is designed to be portable and not for superior audio quality.Ease of Use:Very easy to connect to, worked with both my phone and computer on Bluetooth. My phone asked for the password whereas my computer did not. The instructions say that if you are asked for a password/pin, it is 0000. Bluetooth reception is not great if there are walls between your device and the speaker, but this was expected. Across an open area, I got clear audio from 30ft away. I also used it to play audio with a 3.5mm audio cable, one is included.If you are looking for a small portable speaker that include Bluetooth, then I would definitely recommend this one."}

This one however is poorly designed and doesnt work as intended.First of all, where the S-View window is attached has started unraveling after a few short days of use. This isnt the most annoying aspect however. The case doesnt fit flush over the screen, and this causes the phone to think that the case is being opened and closed constantly. As you can guess, the battery life suffers as a result. A simple magnet latch that holds the S-View flap on the screen would have been great. I have had many cases with such a feature. I thought that the added weight of a credit card on the inside would give enough weight to hold the flap down on the screen, but it doesnt. I have stopped using this case altogether."}

{"id": 1219, "text": "For years Ive been looking for a pair or ear phones like this.  For years I have continuously gotten long ear phone cords caught on exercise equipment or caught on my own arm in the middle of exercises.  With technology today drooling over bluetooth technology I often wondered, do they make bluetooth ear phones?  Why yes, yes they do.Plantronics BackBeat GO 2 are easy and quick to charge with the accompanying charger.  They are easy to turn on and off, with voice prompting you along the way.  Easy to turn up the volume, pause, and change tracks right from the cord.  Only issue I had with them was I paired them one day and the next day it was not recognized by my iPhone.  Re-pairing is as simple as hitting the plus & minus buttons at the same time.Take your time in finding the right size earbuds.  There are 3 different sizes included and it makes a huge difference in sound quality if you have the wrong ones in.  Some are complaining that the 5 hours of continuous charge time is too little, but I cant honestly remember the last time I needed to use earbuds for that period of time."}
{"id": 1220, "text": "These are supposed to automate tedious tasks, but sadly using them is even more tedious. I bought them to automate starting the music player in the car, however to use them you have to remove the phone from its case and unlock it.....having done that I might as well just push play myself.The Samsung app is pretty basic, and even the option to play music is only for one specific song. So if you want to hear the same song everytime (and only once) then these work great. If you just want the music player to continue where it left off last time, youre out of luck.So being unable to use them for what I wanted, I explored other options. But I cant for the life of me think of a single task that I regularly perform that I cant do faster manually. I regularly use the phone as a wireless hotspot for my tablet, but having to unlock the phone first means its already in my hand and out of its case, so Settings-Network-Tethering and Hotspot-On really only takes 1 more second anyway. And then where do I put the TecTile? In my wallet? So now to automate a simple task I have to unlock the phone AND get my wallet out?Maybe Im just showing my age, but I find these totally pointless. They do work, so I cant give them a really low rating, but mine are all still in the packet as I just cant find a use for them."}
{"id": 1221, "text": "I recently had the opportunity to try out something new... a set of Kamor 5 X Waterproof NFC Tags. These NFC tags are well-made, and theyre a good option if you want to use tags that will maintain some durability in areas that might not be protected or ding-free.The packaging of the tags is easy to open (I hate platic clamshells that require sharp knives to tear apart), and each tag has its own plastic sleeve. In the past, I had used Samsung Tec Tile NFC tags, but they were very flimsy in their construction. These Kamor tags have substance to hold up over the long term, while still remaining easy to stick to various surfaces. The key tag chain is especially sturdy, and it feels as if it will hold up to the daily wear of being on a keychain. The tags also come with stickers that you can use to label the tags for identification and purpose. Nice touch...The instructions on the tags indicated that tapping on a tag would install some required software. However, the tags are blank out of the box and do not direct you to any application. I had to go to the Google Play store to download the NXP tag writer application. I found that the app isnt overly intuitive, and it isnt very easy to program useful actions into the tags. I ended up using the Samsung Tectile application instead, as it was easier to use. It also programmed and read the tags perfectly.Overall, the Kamor NFC tags are a very nice product. My only negative observations are that they could use better instructions along with a better, more intuitive application for programming. But if you already have some experience with NFC tags, then these are a good choice for tags that need to be more durable over the long run.Disclosure:Obtained From: YoSpacePayment: Free"}

The one small downside is that it really picks up all the finger prints so you can see every little blemish.  Bolse really knows how to make a strong charger.  These come with the 2.0 amp  and 1.0 amp.  No matter what kind of phone I use, I always charge on the 2.0.  Im not sure if it damages the phone or not but Ive always found it to charge much faster.  I was able to to charge from a 10% to 70% in less than 40 minutes while I was shopping at Target.  I was really impressed with the strength of the charger and I think this company will go far.All the chargers from Bolse but they are top notch and well worth it all. I received this item for an honest review."}
{"id": 1223, "text": "I think Ive tried out just about every level of external battery pack from 2200mAh to 15000mAh as part of a series of reviews. The latest (and probably not the last) is the Bolse M3 6600mAh Dual Port External Battery Pack. Like every other Bolse external battery Ive used, the M3 is an excellent combination of looks, weight, capacity, and features.The 6600mAh capacity puts it in the mid-range of battery packs youd normally find. The M3 has two ports for output, with one powered for a normal smartphone charge and the other powered for charging an iPad. Or, if you want to be popular with your friends, you can charge two smartphones at once. Charging the battery pack is done with a normal micro-USB cord (included), and the cord is also used for the included plug adapters (Apple 30-pin, mini-USB, and normal Blackberry/Samsung/Nokia/other smartphones). Theres a velvet pouch included that will hold the cord and adapter plugs so you can keep things in one place (the plugs could easily become scattered).Like the Bolse M2, the M3 has a digital readout on the front to indicate how much power you have remaining. I find this feature incredibly useful, as it takes the guesswork out of interpreting whether one LED bar means 2% or 22% power left. This feature has spoiled me, and its one of the reasons why these Bolse units are among my go-to choices in battery packs.The Bolse M3 6600mAh Dual Port External Battery Pack is definitely in my usage rotation if I need a battery pack that will get me through the day with my iPad (or through two or three days with my iPhone). Its a great choice for the price and features.Disclosure:Obtained From: LowerPriceUSAPayment: Free"}

There are still plenty of S3s being sold as of now. Peoples complaint about the peeling of the pink rubber around the rim is valid. However, this resolves itself. After about a week whatever this thin layer is peels off completely and looks perfect now. I never experienced this with my S4 case. Im unsure if this is color related as mine is grey or if was a compound problem. Either way this wouldnt keep me from buying this case again.Second problem that is more annoying is the hole at the bottom for the charging port they decided to put a thin piece of the plastic to enclose the front of the charging port. To think that this piece would have ever lasted is a complete joke. This was corrected on my S4 case as they just used the silicone rubber to enclose the charging port like they do on the headphone port.Long story short I think this is a great case and the peeling wouldnt prevent me from buying it again but the crack at the bottom while barely noticeable, shouldnt happen on a case that retails for $35.If you have an S4 get one!

Its a great product for what it really is and really admire the o-ring design and perfect fit and slim design but this is not for the very large majority of people.

Really surprised how amny of these have sold and are pushed heavily in the big box stores too ... it should be a niche only product."}

I bought it in the pink glitter and, when the phone gets hot, the color goes away and you can see the phone through the case.  Once the phone/cover cools, the color of the cover returns.  The cover keeps my phone from slipping out of my hands and has done a good job protecting my phone during drops. Unfortunately, I had my phone in the bathroom while I was coloring my hair and I accidentally got a stain on my cover. I just ordered a new one in hot pink.

The second when he was on vacation in Florida due to the temperature of the air.While the screen protector was on, he loved it.  He said there was a self-healing thing the protector did. Anytime there was a scratch on it, it would eventually go away.The product description is correct that the protector does come off without sticky residue or anything left on the screen. I have not tried to contact the company to get him replacements yet.  I havent had the time so I cannot attest to the lifetime replacement guarantee.  I will update my review once Ive done this.Three stars for this product.  When the protector stayed on, it was perfect.

This flip phone along with a prepaid card does EVERYTHING that we need it for, for a fraction of the cost of a &#34;Uber Phone&#34;. Heck, the phone along with a years worth of minutes, was probably less than what a monthly charge could be for some people. Dont get me wrong, many people NEED all the bells and whistles. Since we still have a landline, (oh,,,now dont judge - its a VIOPO based line, so, we are not THAT far into the dark ages! LOL), and since we also dont need the phone, for communications from the house a cell phone would go to waste - why pay for something, that  hardly ever gets used, for most of the month?The TracFone line, also has phones that are &#34;smart phones&#34; and have web based apps and such,,,the TracFone line of products, [to me], is a really GREAT way to save money, and budget for cell phone payments and costs. Children that are getting a phone for the first time, or, teenagers that text till the cows come home, can dig DEEP into a family budget,,,using the TracFone, teaches restraint as well, you can see how many minutes you have used, or have left  - its a great way, to teach younger folks, how to keep the texting and talking down, without unhappy surprises on a bill, that you were not expecting to see that month!"}

Holy Bananas.. compared to my Igeek this is almost a brick. I could put my IGeek in my back pocket and have no problem but this isnt the type of unit you can do that with. I am also missing having indicator lights. I am confused as to why this unit, being that it is the biggest New Trent charger, does not have them. How am I to know how much is left or I have used? The small light next to the power button is ok but, indicator lights would make this product a 5 star one! I always turn to New Trent and Ideal Point for my charging needs and I will continue to do so!"}

{"id": 1383, "text": "I mean all in all the case is decent for protecting your expensive phone but its not an Otter Box by any stretch. And the QR code for being able to retrieve it if its lost like others have said is a novel idea but it really relies on an honest person on the end of that transaction. Im hoping the next iteration will allow this case to be found more directly by you. As in a case that even if somebody steals your phone and disables or wipes the phone as long as the case is attached you can still located to me that would be the ideal case for todays world. And I know a case like that would cost more money but I think it be worth it. But when I saw this case thats kind of what I thought.Now I did not use the QR code to share my personal information it seems like it would work pretty straightforwardly but she is not something I really need to use. Plus nowadays its pretty easy to say follow me on twitter or Facebook.But I think for $15 if you want an extra layer of security it might be worth it but then again if you have an honest person who find your phone as long as its not locked there be able to get your personal information and get back to you.Thanks for reading hopefully you never lose your phone because that would suck."}

Overall it doesnt add too much bulk to an already big phone.Cons:  The stand on mine is very difficult to pop out without a little prying help.  I have a feeling that the belt clip will eventually break off but they always do, even on expensive cases.  It is uncomfortable to carry the case with the phone mounted vertically.  I will say in one instance my phone fell out of the case when it was mounted horizontally but it is possible I put it in wrong.Impression:  Good case for the money."}

I went to Target and purchased a new Apple USB cable, and Im able to charge again.  But Im left with this piece of garbage now.

It seems there is no shortage of cheap options, but with such a large amount of 1 star ratings, I stayed away.  This Belkin had decent ratings, and I also noticed it was a bit cheaper than another Belkin cable, AND this one has a car charger.Ive used it daily for a week, and it charges fine.  I do have concerns that the pin requires a significant amount of force to insert it into my iPhone, and even greater force to remove it.  Im hopeful this will hold up over time, without causing damage to my phone."}

It arrived brand new in the T-mobile box, with all manuals, a micro SIM card (so you dont need to buy or cut down one), charger and cable.  I took it to a local T-mobile shop with a micro SD card I had from my previous phone and they quickly fired it up and switched my phone number to it.  I added the $10 for an extra 2Gb of data which also allows the wireless hotspot to be used.Pros:-Size very thin and light, little wasted space around the screen.-4G is quite fast though it varies depending on location.  At home I get 12Mbps down and 6Mbps up.  Its been as low as 1/6 of that various other places Ive checked (using the speedtest.net app).-The hotspot transfers every bit of that speed to a tablet signed in to it.-Extremely good GPS.  Better than any other phone Ive had (tested using GPS Test app).-Call clarity and controls are good.-Screen is very clear and responsive.-Bluetooth pairs quickly with no issues.Cons:-Storage: 1.8G, lots of bloatware that cant be removed.-Speaker: Not very loud.Neither Pro nor Con:-Battery life.  I can generally go a whole day without having to charge.  It uses micro USB to charge so just keep spare cables in the vehicle and at work.Im very pleased with this purchase."}

I didnt find the hide apps feature like the older bbs so thats no.  I love the slide up unlock. Simple browser.....ok now on to the bad which is everything else. The design is meh it comes off as some older android phone and its not all that thin like all your popular phones. Then the apps? Its been 6 months out and no standout apps. Most popular apps on app store are are prices at $2.99 on here so forget about spending lots of money on apps.  I didnt notice any exclusive features that the s4 or htc one doesnt already do. Its just a redesigned blackberry storm thats boring living in 2006 thinking people was going to get all excited just because oh look its a blackberry #### nope those days are over they are going to have to bring exclusive features in todays world.

Nonetheless I wanted post some information about the case for anyone who is considering it.1) Buy it from a reputable dealer--there are TONS on eBay extremely cheap and sadly, theyre fake.  I bought a couple trying to save money and had to file an item not as described case with eBay.2) The clear screen will always have finger prints and smudge marks on it.3) The phone automatically switches to the clock view when you close the case.4) You can answer your phone without opening the case, but your voice will be muffled since the case is blocking the path between your phone and your mouth.5) The case replaces the back of your phone.  Personally I loved this because it keeps the phone super thin and it keeps the original back safe and sound in case I decide to resell the phone later.6) If you have small hands it can make answering your phone with one hand a little awkward.7) Using your camera can be difficult.  I say this because the case keeps you from easily holding the four corners of your phone so youre forced to hold the case and tilt the phone from the case.If you find any questions for me please comment on my review and I will reply as soon as I can!"}

{"id": 1424, "text": "Maybe Im spoiled by all of my previous Seidio cases. Ive used them almost exclusively where I could. Blackberry Bold, 8800, Note 2, Galaxy Nexus, etc... Ive always purchased black cases, so the plastic has always been somewhat grippy and refractive to sweat. With the minor exception of my old Nexus case, the build quality has always been excellent. Superb fit and finish. Never needlessly bulky.Because my Galaxy S4 is white, I decided to get a white case w/ black holster combo. Again theres the usual Seidio attention to detail. The cut-outs for the micro USB port are square just like the USB cable provided by Samsung. The act of slipping the ends of the case together over the phone doesnt scrape needlessly over the power and volume buttons (a problem with other cases Ive tried at the T-Mobile store). Being able to take the phone out of the holster with one hand (hard to do with other cases where you slip the phone in and out as opposed to unclipping it) is great.If I have any complaints, its that the case is slick as snot. I guess the grippy and soft touch plastic that is used on the black case variant is not available in white. Ive yet to try blue or red. I plan to purchase a black case as well.If you need a stand that works in portrait mode, the holster/case combo sold in T-Mobile stores (T-Mobile branded - no idea who the OEM is) does work in portrait mode. I suppose if the metal stand on the Seidio case were a little more stiff or had a lock, it too could work in portrait mode. But it doesnt. The spring isnt strong enough.Overall, great quality, great buy and I would never hesitate to recommend it. If the slick case bothers you, opt for the black case.I noticed that Seidio customer service is responding to some of these reviews. Maybe they can answer this question - do the red and blue cases offer the same soft-touch plastic that the black units have (and the white units lack)?"}

{"id": 1437, "text": "Our first ZeroLemon extended battery was given to me by the manufacturer in exchange for doing a thorough review of the product. That battery (for my Galaxy Note 2) turned out to be the best extended life cell phone battery Ive ever used; so when my wife got her new Galaxy S4 and wanted a good extended battery, deciding which battery to purchase was an easy decision.After placing our order, the battery arrived in just two days via US Mail in a bubble wrap lined envelope that contained one weird looking battery, a case that also is a replacement for the OEM phone back, several sets of instructions and a warranty card with return envelope in case you have an issue and need to replace your battery. This being our second ZL battery, we knew what to expect as far as how the battery would sit partially outside the phone body, but with this S4 battery, we encountered a problem that didnt show up with my Note 2 battery. The battery did not want to slide into the battery bay and lock in to place.  After a lot of work and finally, a lot of studying the battery, I found that the plastic tabs on the end of the battery that help seat the battery into place were just a little roughed up. I used my fingernail and ran it along the sides of the tabs and then with effort, the battery snapped into place as it should have.The ZeroLemon battery itself is huge and odd looking. It looks like a stock battery has been married to a phone-sized square, so the stock shaped portion fits into the battery compartment and the large square actually sits outside the compartment and is held in by the replacement phone case. I was a little concerned that the case would not be rigid or tight enough to hold the battery in place, and had visions of the phone turning off every time I handled it. My fears turned out to be completely unfounded. Ive had the ZL battery in my Note 2 for a couple months now and despite having dropped the phone quite a few times on the floor of my truck, the phone has never once lost power. The same has held true for the battery in my wifes S4.The case is made of TPU, which is my favorite inexpensive case material. My family owns seven phones and all our cases are TPU. This case is a little different from the TPUs we own in that it has a matte finish instead of a high gloss. I actually prefer the finish because it adds a little anti-slip quality to the phone. One of the things Ive found about having this battery and case on my phone is that it actually makes it easier to handle. The extra thickness added by the extended battery makes the phone easier to cradle in the palm of your hand, and therefore easier to hold on to. While I do like this case (and love the battery) it was the case alone that caused me to initially rate my first ZL battery (the one for my Note 2) 4 stars instead of five. The two problems are that the case makes the volume and power buttons a little more difficult to press (the biggest issue) and it makes the phone less secure in my dash mounted cradle. After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to change my rating from four to five stars, because I feel it may be unfair to gig such a great battery for such a small failing in the supplied case.Finally we come to battery performance. These batteries truly are The Real Deal. My phone stays in constant use throughout the day, as it is my secondary GPS, web browser, phone, fax... you name it. With the OEM battery, Id get about three or four hours use before Id be down to ten percent or so on my battery indicator and Id have to plug in. With this battery, I go all day. I unplug in the morning, and it usually is down to single digits by the end of my work day (16 to 20 hours long for me, seven days a week). The ZL battery for my wifes S4 has performed every bit as well as the one in my Note 2. Because of my wifes cancer treatment, we regularly spend eight to ten hours sitting in the hospital. We used to bring three extra OEM batteries with us, just so we could stay connected throughout the day. Now, with our ZL extended batteries, we start the day out with one fully charged battery and by the time were pulling out of the parking garage to head home, we might be down to the 50% mark. These batteries seem to last forever.All things considered, Im very impressed with ZeroLemon batteries. They are by far the best extended batteries Ive ever owned. This battery is a little pricey, but its well worth the money. The battery itself is awesome. Even the case offers some improvements over what I had; its just not perfect. If easy access to the volume and power button is high on your list of priorities, then maybe this product isnt for you; but if youre looking for amazingly long life in a single battery, then shell out the money for this battery, because in my experience, you cant do any better."}

{"id": 1439, "text": "Summary: This unit has a very nice design and works well, now available at a better price. [updated 7/2/2014]The ET-NP056K is definitely made of high quality materials, even the USB cable is a step above, being an attractive, matching color, flat style cable, so you will always know its the right one.  The case is covered with a very nice rubberized material which looks elegant and provides a good grip, so this wont slip out of your fingers and drop (some of the competition could learn from this).  The indicator lights are nice and provide a good estimate of remaining battery power, and the controls are very simple, making this device quite easy to use.5600mAh is a very good power rating for this size device and should handle all phones with ease and is even enough for most tablets.  There are two USB charging ports, 1 and 2.1 amps, the 1 amp port is for phones and other low powered devices, and the 2.1 amp for tablets and other devices which need more power.  Both ports can be used at the same time with some extension in charging time.The device is simple to use, just plug in your device and wait.  The on/off switch is really used just to check remaining battery capacity and to activate the low powered single LED flashlight function. Press once and the 4 LEDs light up to show battery capacity remaining, each LED is 25%, so 4 LEDs = fully charged and 1 = 25% or less capacity remaining. After a brief time the LEDs turn off automatically.  Press the button twice and the low power single LED light comes on.  Press twice again to turn it off. Think key ring style light output, not really flashlight level by any stretch, still a nice bonus feature.  A lanyard/wrist strap is included and is also of matching color and high quality.  This is without a doubt the best looking device of its type I have seen.  Also very sleek and small, would easily fit into a pocket, purse, bag, or whatever and is very light weight.Oddly, nowhere in the instruction manual does it tell you how to charge the device itself.  While its very obvious, I guess, you use the provided cable and plug into the USB port of your PC/laptop or a USB A/C adapter, still its a puzzling omission. No other USB cables or connectors are provided, assumption is your device came with those, I guess.Quibbles: No A/C adapter is included, at this price that seems a bit strange.  The manual is terse and barely adequate, but is sufficient.  Comparable devices sell for less that half the price of this unit, though they are a bit shy of this device in terms of ease of use, attention to detail, and quality of materials.  Still, you are paying quite a premium here for style.  That said, it is one of the best devices of this type I have seen and if quality materials, function, and style are important to you, this may be your best choice.Final rating: 4 stars primarily for lack of USB A/C adapter and relative value.  (5 stars for design and function.)(Postscript: Believe it or not, it is possible to attach the wrist strap, even though the hole provided is so very small it is quite difficult.  I was able to use a small screwdriver (the kind used for eye glasses) to push it through the microscopic hole.  Not sure why they made it so small, a minor flaw in an otherwise very well designed case, but it works.)"}
{"id": 1440, "text": "Sold by Eagle Tech, an American company, but made in China, this pocket sized, 5600 mAh battery pack can charge my phone approximately three times on one charge and my iPad mini almost fully on one charge. It is colorful and sized to be comfortable to hold or fit in a purse or bag. It has a four light indicator to tell you how much charge is still available and a small light that serves as a (weak) flashlight in case you need to locate your phone in the dark. Its easy to charge using the USB to mini cable, included, and your computer or any cell phone charger that has a USB port. Charging your apparatus (phone or iPad, etc.) is also easy using either the 1 or 2 A USB port and the cable from your phone or iPad. This is an invaluable item to bring along for travel or when you know youll be using your phone/iPad a lot.The only reason I did not give five stars is the lack of good directions for use and the price. There are several units that are just slightly less powerful and considerably less expensive or similar in price but significantly more powerful. Eagle Tech has made a good product but they need to consider the price point of their competitors."}

{"id": 1445, "text": "All of my previous reviews of wireless headphones were focused around sound quality, noise isolation, and ear tip fitment. Now, here comes a new chapter in wireless headphones with all these rules out of the window. Based on a military technology of bone conduction, AfterShokz were designed to sit outside of your ears conducting the sound through your cheekbones to your inner ear - a shortcut bypassing your eardrums. I know, the description of this process doesnt sound too attractive, but once you get these wraparound headphones on - it will make a perfect sense. I was a bit confused myself reading the description, thats why I couldnt wait to receive my review sample, to test it out, and to share my first hand experience.Once you open the box, the first thing you notice is a very nice and sturdy carrying case which is the size of the box itself. These are not earbuds or some foldable headphones, but rather a full wraparound band headphones with a unique design shape where having a carrying case with a generous bonus storage pocket is a great idea. For anybody who has Tone+ or similar headphones, you will know what I mean when its time to pack your headphones and you wish you would have a carrying case to protect these from breaking. Once you take headphones out, you couldnt believe how lightweight these are at only 1.5 ounces (43 grams). These are designed to wrap around back of your head with ear piece pads aligned to sit right in front of your ears. The pads are soft rubberized and form a tight seal around attachment. As stated by manufacture, these are water resistant and sweat proof, backed up by 2 year warranty, and you can clearly see that from a solid design. For a better fitment there is a adjustable rubber tension band that hooks inside of headphone band, and it does a good job keeping these up without falling down on your shoulders.The controls are located on the sides of earpieces and on the back of the headphone band. First of all, big thumbs up for a dedicated physical sliding power switch. There is no second guessing if you turned these on/off, or if they are still paired up or in a standby mode. You turn it on and get a voice prompt about connecting, pairing up, and battery status (when you hit volume buttons). Right next to it you will find a standard micro-usb charging port. Bluez also come with a high quality micro-usb cable that you can use with your own wall adapter or charging from your laptop/PC usb port. These headphones are rated for up to 6 hours of continuous playback time, and standby time of up to 10 days. Also, it supports all the available bluetooth profiles (A2DP, AVRCP, HSP, HFP), and once paired up I tested it for up to 50ft wireless range in my house until I got disconnected. Also, on the back you will find Volume up/down controls which double as playback control when you hold it down to skip Next/Prev while playing songs. Typically, volume and playback skip controls are not the most used functions so having it on the back of the headphone band is not a bad idea. For your common most used play/pause and call functions, these two buttons are placed on either side of the sound earpieces. Very elegantly designed, those fit in the corner and easy to locate and operate either if you are playing music from your phone/tablet or need to pick up/hangup a call. Both functions work as expected, and receiving and carrying on a phone call worked great.But the main point of these headphones: how does it sound? AfterShokz manual refers to earpieces as transducers since they actually dont go into your ear. As I mentioned before, they sit in front of it, right on your cheekbone, and it WORKS!!! There is no vibration or anything you might associate with bone conducting terminology. Although the sound is not the same as you will experience with in your ear headphones, its loud and clear and you can actually feel some bass. This is not the same as if you would take regular over the ear headphones and slide them down to your cheekbone, the sound is actually almost like if you would have headphones over your ears. For a test purpose, I even put earplugs while listening through Bluez to make sure its not the sound bleeding out of these that I hear. With earplugs in, you loose some high frequency content but can still hear mids and low frequencies which conducting through your cheekbone. Another thing to point out, you will not be welcome to use these on a plane or a bus or anywhere else where you expecting to have privacy while enjoying the sound. To outsiders, these are like a pair of high frequency speakerphones on your ears - it is quite noticeable. So my theory on this bone conductive technology is that low frequencies and some mids are conducted through a bone, while all your high frequencies get to your ears by the sound bleeding out of these transducers. That is the only thing that makes sense to me how they work, and from all the testing I have done.Overall, I found these to be very unique piece of technology. They are not for all around everyday use if your intention to enjoy private sounds or phone conversation. Also, as you move around and tilt your head the sound will change a bit because of the transducer positioning and reception of high frequency content (lows and mids wont be affected that much). BUT, for a sport activity or any other activity where you dont want to have full noise isolation and actually require to stay alert with a surrounding environment while listening to your music or carrying on phone conversation - these are irreplaceable!!! Furthermore, I read a number of posts from people who have partial hearing loss and use these to listen to music since they bypass eardrums. I personally can think of a number of uses myself where Im riding a bike, or doing gardening outside, or hiking outdoors, or when Im working out in my home gym - just a few examples where these can come very handy since you still enjoying a music, have full wireless control of the playback (the sound quality is actually not bad at all!!!), can pickup the call, dont have anything plugged into your ears, and can still get alerted by everything that is going on around you. A definitely innovative piece of technology."}

{"id": 1447, "text": "I just purchased a new smartphone with lots of amazing features however the battery life runs out quite quickly so I needed some sort of external battery charger I could carry with me to easily charge my device with.  I decided to purchase the new I torch by Trent. This battery pack is wonderfully convenient and fits easily in my pocket or purse. I quickly charges my device fully and has enough power to charge my device fully about 5 times! Ive tried other external battery charging devices only to be disappointed by there performance.  Trent I torch will not disappoint!  Its extremely easy to use and is compact enough to carry anywhere with you on the go. It has a nice cable thats perfect length to enable you to still use your device while its changing!  It has a display that when pressed shows you how much power is still available in the battery pack which is a very nice feature. It also uses the same charger as my cell phone making it very convenient to charge. It comes with a handy flash light and a laser pointer. Its fairly light and feels good in the hand. This is a absolute necessity for Smart Phone owners. Whenever and where ever my phone needs a charge I simply use my I torch and pull it out of its handy carrying case  that comes with it. I plug in the provided usb cable and Im good to go. This product has a very powerful battery and your devices will quickly charge no matter where you are! I dont leave home without it! It exceeded my expectations! I highly recommend this product! Now I dont worry about my battery dieing I know no matter where Im at I can easily and conveniently use my I Torch to recharge my device.  This is a must have product ! Thank you trent for this quality product! It works wonderfully!  I no longer worry about my battery level. I know I can count on my I torch to charge my device fully without any problems! This is a quality device and its so convenient!  Five stars to the I torch by trent! Amazing product! I dont leave home without it! A must have for smartphone owners!"}

A little staticky in places but I havent isolated if that is the phone, Vonage, or  the conference service I use.Setup was straight forward and setting the time and date are easy. I havent used to many other options on the phone except mute and conference and both are easy enough. The headset is flimsy and cheap feeling especially if your used to Plantronics quality, but it does its job and the sound quality is good.Overall a nice travel phone that stays out of the way.Update - June 23rd - More than one year later, its breaking.Close to one year later. I reduced this to one star because after daily typical office only use the headphone is starting to crackle and drop audio. It seems the connection into the carry on base unit is somehow dropping the connection which makes this essentially useless. This carries a one year warranty so this is just past the point of help. It was very rare for me to actually take the headphone out of the base which could have caused some connection issues, so Im not certain how it lost its audio."}

For a person working in a techy environment and loving/having too many techy stuff, this is a must have!Have you been in situations where you need to do something important with your phone but you failed to notice earlier that youre already almost running out of juice? And whats worse is that even how much you tried to look for some way you can recharge your phone, theres just no easy way. Oh well, say goodbye to your problem with the help of this New Trent iCarrier IMP120D. Husbands (like me), sorry but you have no excuse your phone run out of juice anymore (wives, rejoice).PROS:- Small, it fits most pants pockets- Lightweight, wont require big muscles to carry- Juicy, w/ 12000mAh you can bring a lot of gadgets back to life (I have the following gadgets with me most of the time: Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Wireless Headset, Beats Wireless, iPad Mini... But wait, theres more (from my wife), she has iPhone 5, iPod Classic. I was not able to power them all at once (because theres only 2 USB sockets) but I was able to charge them all in one full charging of my New Trent iCarrier IMP120D.- Versatile, I used to have Mophie battery packs but it didnt last and its not very versatile like this because it is using fixed iPhone(30 pin) plug. Guess what, when I bought my Samsung Galaxy S4 and even my new iPad Mini(using lightning plug), I cant use it anymore. Whats worse is that it cost me $50 before and I cant even charge a second phone with it.- 2 is better than 1! w/ 2 USB ports, what could be better than that? I know, 1 USB port w/ 1A and 1 USB port w/ 2.1A. I also like the battery level indicator (LOW, MED, HIGH).CONS:- Pouch bag. It could be better. I prefer using Micro Fiber Cloth than that. But a rugged case would also be ideal for adding protection to the unit.- LED Lights. I prefer to be able to turn of the LED lights especially when Im charging. I would suggest turning it off automatically after 5 seconds when youre using the unit for charging and youll be able to turn it on again with one push of the on/off button to check the battery level.WHAT ELSE COULD MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER:- All-In-One USB plug included in the package (like this: B005JZP4QQ but with lightning plug too. I know, I know, I hate Apple too for not using standard USB for their devices, but what else can we do, right??"}

Let me start out by saying this thing is awesome, Ive had this over 8 months now and its not lost any suction and I only had it fall off once because it was over 100 degrees outside and the car had been sitting in direct sunlight. I cleaned it with regular soap and water and the stickiness came back to about 98% which isnt bad. The arms actually have grooves on the top and bottom so it will hold on to the edges of your phone nicely and securely. My phone has not fallen out of the arms once and I am hard on my things which my wife yells at me all the time. I used to just slide the phone out without any care and I even let the plastic slap against each other more than a dozen times and its still held up well. Now it doesnt work on your dashboard if its got any grooves in it. I have yet to find one that has that type of suction. If I ever find it I will be very happy. If youre looking for something that will last over time then this is it. It will stay on your windshield at any temperature except 100 degrees but really when is it really that hot? Get the darn thing and attach it to your windshield and youll be happy. I bet you youll love it. It can even hold a soda can filled with soda and still not fall off.

I just slid my (short) nails under the bottom right hand corner of the front of the case and popped it right off. It didnt break when I removed it either. I got the case because I wanted one that didnt obstruct the headphone jack or the charging port as much as most cases do. It fits that bill in every respect and offers more protection than leaving the iPhone naked. I didnt find that the case felt any more slippery than the CaseCrown cases I reviewed previously.As for looks, however, I would agree with what the other reviewers of this color say: it is dull and unattractive. Looking at the pictures, I thought it would have a pearlescent sheen. Nope. Also, dirt collects around the openings and edges very quickly and isnt always easy to remove. Being that the case is so light-colored (and dull), the dirt is very visible. Less than a week after I received this case, I ordered the identical case in sport yellow to replace it. Once I had replaced the vanilla case with the new one, my mother said, I like your yellow case. I didnt want to tell you before, but that other one was UGLY.Case closed (and now sitting in my closet)."}

But given the fact of what this protector is made of, it is common for it to do so.TIP: Watch a video on the installation.  make sure you wipe it down with a clean microfiber cloth and start with freshly washed and dried hands.  Most important that you wet your hands, top of the screen protector, sticky side of the protector with the solution.The &#34;healing&#34; technique works best if you leave it and the gadget in the sun for at least 2-3 minutes and then let it cool down on its own.

I thought, here I am, with essentially Amazons FASTEST charger, charging a GS4 at 1% per FIFTEEN minutes -- and Im SURE I have it in the right port.  I swapped it out for the stock samsung usb cable and ZOOM, I literally watched the percentages fly up!  Okay, maybe Im exaggerating but definitely you can get a 1% boost in 2 to 3 minutes.  Really useful for those days when youre in dire need of power and your next destination is only 15 minutes away.  Quick jolt of juice to get you good for the next couple hours.

So instead of having two devices, I use this one.I purchased a used (locked to Sprint) Note 2 on Amazon from a seller that got the phone from someone else.  Unbeknownst to the seller, the old owner rooted the phone with Teamwins recovery tool.  I never rooted the iPhone (never saw the point in it), so I got a crash course in rooting.  After causing issues with my accounts and preventing Samsung updates, I almost gave up on this phone.As a last ditch effort, I used the rooting to my advantage; I put on Cyanogenmods 4.3 firmware!  Unlike the iPhone, rooting is worth it on an Android.Android 4.3 is very nice and the phone works even better.  My only complaint is that the S-note function is no longer as polished as Samsung had designed it, but using a handwriting app it meets my needs.I dont use cellular service on this, so I dont know how the reception is.  Basically, I use wifi to make calls using Talkatone and Google Voice.  Between work and home, Im rarely without wifi so why pay $80-$120 for service?

It was clear that for this one, she needed something that would protect the phone against painful drops so I began my search for a good case.  It came down to this one and an otterbox.  The otterbox had excellent reviews and I have heard that most people like them.  But, after reading that the otterbox had small flaps for all the input ports, I ended up going with this one.  My wife finds those flaps irritating as we had them on a previous set of phones years ago.  Not having flaps, and being pink won out, and we purchased this item. We couldnt be happier.  She has dropped it a couple of times already, and its perfectly fine, there is a tiny scratch on the case, not noticeable unless you are really looking for it.I would say the only con is that it is extremely difficult to remove and put on the case.  The corners are rubberized, and flex to allow it, but it is difficult.  Over time I assume this will loosen and be a little easier, but I like to remove and clean under the case every now and then..

It exposes all the right places and seems to have just a tiny lip on top that gives some protection for being put face down (though I have a screen protector on it, too).  Anyway, its very light, very thin, just grippy enough, and really, really attractive! Highly recommended (as long as youre ok with the minimal protection).EDIT: After two months, the case is broken.

Ive had it for almost 9 months and its still going great.  I got my sister to buy one for her and her fiance.This product is for you if you worry about your phone dying throughout the day.  AND it only gets better with use! You wont be disappointed."}

{"id": 1603, "text": "Pros:  The build quality of the case is good; its a hard plastic that fits tightly around the Note 2.The case fits inside the holster very well.  I was a bit worried that the phone would accidentally fall out, but so far no close calls or incidents.  Im not sure I would trust it completely since the clip that allows the phone to exit the holster is rather large and protrudes.Cons: The belt clip broke after a bus seat caught the phone as I was trying to get a seat.  Although I could repair it with a bit of hot glue, turns out I like it without the belt clip.  Despite my ability to overcome a broken belt clip, Im not sure how many others would do the same.  To be fair, the Note 2 would be particularly hard on most belt clips.  The mechanical advantaged produced when the phone gets caught on something puts immense strain on the clip.  The fact is, the phone (or phablet) is big- no getting around it.Overall: I like the case, but I would only recommend this case with the caveat that you need to be a bit cautious with it hanging off your belt."}

{"id": 1606, "text": "First off, I have never liked screen protectors. They just never seem to go on right, they change the &#34;feel&#34; of a touch screen and the sheen is always wrong compared to the original. But I do recognize the value they can offer.So, I gave this brand a try. When I opened the package, right off the bat, I could tell these were in a different class from the rest Id ever tried. It is obvious that thought and design went into the iSmooth product line. A very nice cleaning cloth, sensible instructions, and the &#34;dust removal stickers&#34; added up to an actual installation package, versus, just a screen protector.Now Im pretty good at fine work, but as usual with these things, the first install attempt went badly, and I grumbled to myself why I dont like screen protectors. So I had to discard one of the 3 screen protectors. Grrrrrr....!  Of course, I blamed the product. Then I took a deep breath and tried a second time. Its not the product. OK, I admit it: watch the on-line video first, and this will give you the overview you need.The second attempt went well. Once I got it affixed, for the first time I had a screen protector that did not mar the screen, maintained the integrity of the &#34;feel&#34;, and was the same sheen of the original. In fact, it does not look there is even a screen protector - what a concept. There is a slight change in the tactical feel when using the pen, but I would not mark it down for that.So why 4 stars? I totally disagree with the manufacturer that you should start at top and work down. The alignment is much easier to do at the bottom and work up. The &#34;home button&#34; is a much more definitive reference point than the top. Correct that and theyve nailed it."}

{"id": 1612, "text": "This is a very good screen protector, manufacturers seem to put effort in make it great and easy to use:Pros+ If you install it correctly, it is hard to notices it is even there.+ It is completely transparent (ignore the product picture)+ It is durable and it wont come out (it will help if you use a Case like the Mercury one, in combination works great)+ Comes with 4 screen protectors.+ Each screen protector comes with 3 layers of film, outside layers are to protect the middle, sticky, thin layer. Be careful not to touch it on the side it sticks into your phone, for a better installation.Cons- Very difficult to install. You should clean your phone surface with perfection, and get installed in a confortable dust and any particle free surface and wash your hands, and install it very very carefully as instructed, or youll get bubbles or some particles between the screen protector and your phone, which will affect the looks.- Careful with the position of the screen protector, it is cut to fit Nexus 4 perfectly, so you should perform a perfect installation.I would usually wont use any screen protector at all, but this one fits perfect as if it was a Nexus 4 extension, just be extra careful and patient installing it."}

Attachment was easy tothe ccontacts (agree with other reviewer that the image is incorrect) and rear cover seems to fit well back although a little tighter to put on. When putting on the charger it easily is recognized and charger indicates they are connected (blue light and beep). Battery icon indicate that charging has begun and the screen puts up a notification that it is charging. Charging lasts for anywhere from a few seconds to a fee minutes and then stops. Charger base still indicates there is a connection but the battery icon does not shown charging is occurring.  Have tried for three days now and cannot get it to work. Overall opinion should be zero stars since I view 1 out of 5 as being 20% satisfied. I am 0% satisfied.Will return."}
{"id": 1629, "text": "I bought this for my wifes work phone. I have used Skinomi in the past so I know the quality and all in one kit to do the install was well worth the price.  Please note this is a wet application screen protector. You get a bottle of solution to spray on the protector and device (even though some people tell you not to). In my opinion, wet applications are super easy to install. If you get dust under there upon installation, just remove it, spray water on it to remove the residue and apply on the phone. Use the supplied squeegee and micro fiber cloth to smooth out and squeeze out the water from underneath the screen protector and slide it AWAY from any speaker openings. This being a HTC ONE, where the speakers are facing up, be extra careful there. Just squeegee to the sides of the phone and have the micro fiber cloth catch any of the water. If it is misaligned or you are unhappy with it, you can simply slowly and carefully remove it and start over again, but remember to spray more solution on the protector and your fingers when applying.Bottom line, this protector fit the HTC to almost a to edge to edge. To the untrained eye you cannot see it, but I can lol.  The only negative is that you do not see the awesome true screen because of the protector. In some areas, there are fuzzyness, which I initially thought was left over water. But it was just the screen protector. Its a very minor thing. My wife forgot about it within a day of usage and day to day usage. But bottom line, it is protecting the screen and she can throw the phone in her purse (she does this and kills me because I baby my devices lol) and go on a whim."}

{"id": 1635, "text": "Ill start with the cons or negative issues regarding this item.  Maybe I shouldnt say this, but after applying many screen protectors, there is one thing Ive learned.  Follow,the instructions to the letter!  Even then, I might make a mistake and ruin it.  It makes it difficult to spend this much money on this item knowing that it might become trash.Now for the good and the bad, lol..  First off, I turned off air conditioners, fans and waited til the animals and everyone were settled.  All of this as to not stir dust.  It is a very important step.  I bought the t.slim primarily for the glass screen protector and not so much for the case protector that it also came with.  The screen side went without a hitch and as soon as I let go, what I saw was amazing.  Like a wave the screen applied itself to my phone, sealing from one edge to the other.  I had one bubble under the glass and thought to myself nooooooo!  Slight pressure and like magic, the bubble was gone!  I could now take a breath, phew!  Now for the back.  The back protector seemed to have a static pull to my phone, making it near impossible to lay it on the phone accurately.  The back had to come off several times to get it straight and I have a small dog hair and some bubbles. I have a full coverage spigen case to protect phone anyway.  All in all Im very pleased, once again, I bought it for the screen protection and my screen is nice to touch, not sticky like some protectors.  The colors are vibrant and the feel is like original!  Thanks spigen"}
{"id": 1636, "text": "I have bought screen protectors for the last 4 smart phones that I have owned. Im guessing about 7-9 different brands. A couple were ok and worked but not one of the previous ones I purchased were put on without problems on the first attempt. One pack of 5 I bought took me the whole pack and I got lucky on number 5. Let me mention that I have OCD and watch videos, steam up the bathroom and all that quirky stuff, so Im not just an idiot who cant do it right. Having said all that, I was concerned when buying these tech armors regardless of good reviews. Of course I bought 2 packs of (3) just so I had enough to make mistakes with. Also, I was buying for two phones (Galaxy S4s....wifes and mine). Still did the bathroom thing because I live in California and it doesnt rain for many months so every house pretty much has dust in the air. Also watched the video of which tech armor sent me an email reminder about (thank you!). My S4 is black and the first one went on just like their video (el-perfection). The wifes phone is white which makes it way harder to line up the screen protector because there is no black border contrast. Though I did misalign hers on my first try, I was still able to pull it up (only holding the edges) and place it back down 2 more times before it was perfect. Whew!!! Not only are these the best I ever bought, but if you screw up a little, you can actually still make it work without tossing one. Hers looks as good as mine. Not even the slightest of a bubble or dust (thank you steamy bathroom). So thats it, I bought 6 and only used 2. We will be able to replace them a couple of times over the next couple of years until the next big thing comes out. No question that these are great and its also nice when a company goes the extra step (sending video reminder) to make things perfect. An easy 5 star review for me!"}

I charged in about fifty minutes as I ran the notebook considering this would not be a powerful charge, the time involved til it was charged was wonderful.Then I kept the mini notebook running on empty, using this battery back up.  I fell asleep at around four hours.  Hubby turned off the notebook.I did charge the Arcadia Arc Pak740 to my 16.5 HP laptop.  It charged very fast an was so easy to use How I not recommend this prduct to anyone who wishes to have a good dependable battery backup and charger.  I would recommend this device for anyone who wants to have a fast, powerful charger that is dependable. My Godness, I finally  have a dependable Charging Unit and battery back up.  Happy Dance! Happy Dance!Geekdome will welcome this very practical unit.  It is sleek, modern, easy to use, and seems to be built very well.  The only thing that would make it better for me was in my mailbox this morning.  The NT90C dual Max output Wall charger.  I came back on this morning so I would be able to add this to my review.  I will review the NT90C ASAP.Houston...... It is a deffinate go for backup, Go for Charger."}

Likes how it has a stand and is big enough for a good solid grip.Highly recommend to those looking for an Otterbox alternative and cheap at the same time.Easy to install: Simply fit the Nokia 521 into the Red Silicone and then pop the Black plastic exterior over the red silicone.Took less than 3 minutes."}

It was great for two or three uses then the whole assembly began falling off while I was driving.This one connects easily to the CD slot and holds the phone securely (Thanks to the review with the video for setting it up!).  The initial phone I used it with lost connection to GPS occasionally because it was lower in the vehicle, but I was replacing that phone anyway and the new one has much a much better GPS receiver so that is no longer a problem.While waiting for a protective case I went ahead and put the metal plate inside the phones battery cover.  I selected the one with the adhesive back, as it had plastic to protect the adhesive and I wanted that as an insulator between the plate and the bare SIM and microSD holders.  So I had both the plate and the plastic adhesive cover inside my battery cover.  While it works well, it pushes the phone back cover out enough that the phone seems a little cheap as the back cover doesnt hold as well.  I expect when my case arrives I can put the plain metal plate without adhesive (thinner) plate in the case in it will be perfect again.Minimal vibration, never falls off the magnet, the connection to the dash is secure.  Very good product."}

Face it, at this price point, you will not get anything amazing, but these get the job done with pretty good audio.Audio Quality (Calls): Decent. I hear people good and they hear me clearly too.Conclusion: This headset is does exactly what it it says it does and for pretty cheap. If you need a stereo headset while you are doing things around the house, or working out, these are great. I would not recommend driving with these on, theyre not the best at blocking out sound, but still very good at it and it may be dangerous to drive with them on.If you would like something with better audio/quality in general, I would highly recommend the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset.

And I am not hard on these.Also, the corners, which are always the first to hit when you drop your phone, are almost completely uncovered, making it worthless in that regard.If you only plan to have it so that you can clip your phone to your belt it is fine.  But it will not protect your phone well from dropping, especially if it hits on the corners, and the stand in back (a would-be great feature) is hard to open, yet super flimsy and breaks easily).I have purchased it twice.

{"id": 1772, "text": "I bought this to use with my LG Optimus G, and for basic function is works well.  The pen is actually a very nice, fine-tipped writing instrument with dark black ink. Its very smooth to write with.  However the fact that the cap cannot attach to the pen while its in use is a bit of an inconvenience.  You have to put it in your pocket or set it down, and then hope you dont forget it. On my device, the stylus is functional, though not great. Its a good choice if your main concern is fat-fingering the on-screen keyboard (as I often do). But for writing on the screen of my particular device, it doesnt really stand out. This would not be a good stylus for use with drawing applications, at least not on my phone."}

Speaking of the bling it comes off very easily from just normal use of the phone from either the impact of setting on a surface. If you have your phone inside your purse notice the gems would just come out of place. Also the rim at the charging port end it seems to crack from that point which means this plastic is a very low grade."}

{"id": 1784, "text": "I bought these to replace myMotorola SF200 Sports Headphones.  They perform the same functions, and I will use this review as a comparison between the two.Pros:Have an adjustable ear clip to accomodate those with longer ears.  This is not necessarily an issue for me.The in-ear speakers are not silicone buds that you shove into your ear.  They are plastic and they are meant to sit outside the ear.  I think that because of this they draw more power from the mp3 player and are much louder than the SF200s.  Although they are not as comfortable as the silicone buds, they dont pop out of place like the buds do.The microphone/button function the same as the SF200s, with a single button for call answer/pause (1-click), and next/previous track (2-click, 3-click).The microphone picks up audio very well.Cons:The headphones are made of cheap flimsy plastic.  This must be where the $7 difference is between this product and the SF200s.  I dont know how long theyll last. Ive had the SF200s for a year now and have been through many many hours sweat and rain.  I dont know if the JVCs will hold up as long, but well see.The 3.5mm jack is straight, as opposed to angled.  Thus, it sticks out of players much farther than an angled chack, such as that of the SF200.  This isnt bad in any way, but if I were ever pressed for space near a headphone jack, these most likely wont fit.If you were to ask me if I would prefer the SF200s or the JVCs, Im not sure which I would choose.  Probably the JVCs since they are $7 cheaper, and I really did not like the fit of the SF200s in my ear - the silicone would always come loose and pop out while I was running.  Furthermore, fresh ear wax would build up inside of the buds, and the JVCs dont have that problem.  However, the SF200s are entirelly cased in flexible silicone/rubber material (even the wire), so there is no worry of something cracking or breaking.  I only replaced them because they got a little too wet one day and the button signal would send to the player at random times, pausing my music or skipping to the next/previous track uncontrollably.  If the SF200s would switch from the silicone earbuds towards the plasic ones that wont pop out, then I would definitely switch back."}

{"id": 1786, "text": "I ordered this pouch for my Nexus 4 and I like it. I agree with the previous reviewer who noted that the material feels like craft foam - its pretty soft. But it feels nice in my hands and the pouch looks nice. The pull-tab is a great feature for retrieving your phone. The pouch perfectly matches the form of the phone. The only downside is that I havent been able to use the pouch when I have a Ringke Fusion case on my phone. I am thinking about getting a slimmer case because of this.So Im sure youre thinking why use the pouch AND the case?Heres my reasoning: my pockets always seem to have gritty material (sand) in them. Whenever I put my phone (and case) in my pocket, they pick up this grit and it scratches the case and occasionally the screen (no screen protector) and the bezel (even with a skin, some parts of the bezel are exposed). I also have to remove my phone from the case every few days and blow off dust/dirt that has collected between the phone and the inside of the case. Im hoping that the pouch will help to eliminate this. But I want to keep using a case because I want my phone to be protected when Im using it (i.e. when it is not in the pouch in my pocket).Edit 8/30/2013: I ended up using a BoxWave Crystal Shell for the Nexus 4 in addition to this pouch. The BoxWave shell does not add very much bulk to the phone and it fits in the iGadgitz pouch (it also works great with the Sir Lancelot Holy Grail (tempered glass) screen protector)."}

{"id": 1793, "text": "Full disclosure: I received these as a for review sample so I didnt have to pay for them. I didnt promise a good review in exchange because I never do.I have to admit that I am somewhat biased in favor of cheap capacitive styluses after I used both expensive and one-dollar models and couldnt find a good reason to prefer the expensive ones. Sty-HD gets you a bunch - nine individually wrapped, gloriously colored ones actually - for less than youd pay for one branded alternative, quite possibly manufactured in the same China plant as these.While I do like these styluses, I do not fully love them because their 4-inch length is a little bit too short for my hand. Another half-inch would have made these perfect styluses for me. Anyone with small hands and children should find near-perfect.Here are the reasons to like/love them:- Come in a bunch. Its natural to lose one or two styluses every couple of month so a set of nine should last quite a while.- Shirt pocket clip.- Nice colors.- Nicely packaged and easy to store with an individual pocket in the common 9-styluses wrapper.- Durable, or so they appear after a few days of use.If 4-inchers arent too short for you, get these."}

{"id": 1798, "text": "One of the out-of-the-box things thats a bit different about this battery pack, is the fact that there are not one or two, but rather five charging ports. Most of the battery packs I test tend to be black, but if you like white this is a nice change. The charge is indicated by four LED lights on the side. The directions indicate that there are five LEDs, but there are only four (the directions are for an 11000mAh battery). With five ports you can charge several devices at once if you have to.  Optimally this battery would work best with by only charging a couple of devices at once if you are trying to charge a power hog like an iPad and a phone, but it would work quite nicely if you were trying to charge several devices that drew smaller amounts of power.Its a sleek unit with a lot of power and I knew that charging my iPad would be a quick and easy proposition. It wasnt seriously depleted, but at a 49% charge it had a way to go. With any battery pack I do a simple and somewhat informal test to see how well a battery pack can perform.  I tried out the EC 13000mAh power bank which would be a battery of choice if you need one to power up a tablet on a regular basis, but Id select this one if using one for several smaller devices such as iPhones, iPods, smartphones, Kindles, etc.I liked the presentation of this battery and the other EC I tested. Many of them simply come in small boxes that youd open up and immediately start using. This is one that I might select as a gift. The connectors are laid out nicely side-by-side and the cables have their own spot in a recessed section. The price of this one is most certainly reasonable, considerably less than some Ive tested in a similar mAh range. It is a high-performance battery pack, has a sleek look, and affordability factor that definitely appealed to me.  It does afford overcharge, overvoltage, overcurrent, and short circuit protection.WHATS IN THE BOX:1. EC TECH power bank, 12000mAH2. PSP connector3. Micro 5-pin connector4.

{"id": 1799, "text": "The bottom line on the EC Technology battery is this: it works. It is a very small and very effective external battery that delivers on the premise of being able to fully recharge your small electronic device when you are far away from any power outlets.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this batterys efficiency as I can. I discover that, with the unsurprising exception of the iPad, I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. Ive tested this battery with iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Motorola KRZR,Motorola RAZR,Kindle Keyboard,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the aforementionediPad (First Generation) (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge two or three devices with just one EC Technology fully charged battery. I was only able to charge my iPad to 62% of its full charge, but considering iPads size this is still really impressive.To fully charge this battery it takes about five hours. This is much longer than some other such batteries that I have tested, and I think this is primarily due to the fact that it relies on USB connection for powering. The best way to charge this battery is to leave it plugged in overnight. You can plug it into your computer or a stand-alone USB charger.EC Technology battery is fairly well designed and very compact. Its about twice as thick as iPhone 4/4S, and about half an inch shorter. Its also fairly light, and overall very convenient and portable. The inclusion of a small LED light at the front of the battery means that it can also be used as an impromptu small flashlight.Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with this battery supply. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time.***** Review product provided by the distributor. *****"}

Cant beat a case for the S4 thats under $10.With that in mind, understand that this is going to sacrifice small things in exchange for affordability.

I actually really like this case. But, i got what I paid for & had there been a $2-3 more expensive version which was a tighter fit on the phone (notably the sides running up the screen-edges), Id have purchased that version instead.It wont slip out of your hands, It matches the white fairly well (more of a dirty-vanilla than a Pearl color), and theres ample room for the USB/headphone areas.The good: wont slip out of your hands, case fits the phone, ample cut-out areas for the important things like USB/headphone.The bad: volume buttons are just a bit below set-back in the case making it a bit more of a chore to reach them when needed (after about a week youll compensate)---same can be said with the Power button cut-out.Overall, id recommend this case to a friend who didnt want to spend a lot of $ on a case but still wanted ample protection when sitting it screen-down on a table (the lip helps)."}

There is a magnet to hold the strap closed but it is weak and the strap is a little short if you want to put anything in it other than 2 cards and 2 bills.

This definitely fixed that problem.Pros:* Increased size for the device* A more Grippy surface.* screen and frame protection (the screen is recessed from the frame.)* Very secure belt clip.* Nice belt clip that doubles as a tilt stand.Cons:* For me, the belt clip is TOO SMALL. (I have read many reviews that it is too large, but mine barely fits on my belt (5.11 operators belt).)* it would be nice for Otterbox to make a vehicle mount kit to fit the case, I am unhappy with the gripper type vehicle mountsI think mine was an open box return, so I cannot comment on the screen protector.(It was not present.)Update: Apparently the Defender for this item does not include a screen protector.

The ear buds are likewise comfortable. You can turn your head every which way and you will not run out of cord.Audio: Great. Both the call and music audio sounds great. More rich than the Kinivo headset I have. Of course it is still no $300 studio headset, but it is still very nice.Build Quality: Excellent. This thing feels like it is made to be comfortable in every way and does not feel flimsy or cheap.Conclusion: If you would like a nice, quality headset with good audio quality and you can afford to pay a bit extra for it, this is the one to get. The Kinivo set is nice enough, but this set is just better. You do get what you pay for."}

The top (middle) one is limited to 1A, so make sure to plug in your power hungry devices to the one closest to the edge.Overall this worked flawlessly and it is great to have the dual ports for multi-device charging. Another excellent feature is that the plug folds into the device which makes it MUCH easier for transport while traveling and not resulting in the tines getting bent or poking other things. There is a blue LED on the top of the charger as well that provides an indicator of power which is a nice touch.It would be nice if either port would do the high capacity charging, or if the device supported the 2.1A on both ports simultaneously as devices are moving more and more towards this power hungry nature. In the end though, this is an excellent charger with only minor gripes that are relatively inconsequential.Highly recommend the product."}

I experienced no apparent issues in the device use, but I did find myself wondering if the device was turned on or not once I turned it on for charging. Since the LED light does not light up while it is charging, the only way to tell it is turned on seems to be to look at the charging status of the connected devices. Perhaps a periodic blink of the LED to let the user know the pack is turned on may be useful.It easily kept all my devices charged fully and still had tons of battery to spare. You could truly use this for multiday heavy use without any external power. This would be a great addition to an international trip or an outdoor adventure.

Replaced stock battery with the Anker and charged it to 100%, that was at 9:01 PM.  It is now 12:39 AM and my battery capacity is down to 25%!  That is 75% in a little over 3 and 1/2 hours.  Sorry but that is not acceptable.  I will request an RMA and will be sending this battery back.  I will try another since I have normally had great success with these Anker batteries.  I will keep you posted.UPDATE:  Anker sent me another one free of charge.  They actually contacted me.  I returned the original to Amazon for credit.

Have an all day conference call?  This battery will laugh at your conference call.  Want to video your all day city tour without a charger?  Not a problem.Its basically a replacement S3 battery attached to another battery that takes up the lower 2/3 of your phone.  To hold the behemoth in place, they supply a cover that you use instead of your S3 cover, which is surprisingly easy to remove.  The cover fits over the phone and holds the battery in place, but allows full use of the camera without interference. Ingenious!Of course it makes your phone 3+ times as thick, and 3 times as heavy but it still fits comfortably in your pocket and is comfortable to hold so who cares.  It charges fully overnight.  When you dont need it, pull it out after you finished charging it and use your regular battery.  When I put it back in after a month of non use, this guy is still 99% charged.It also makes a great spare, for times you forget to charge your battery, so I keep this one charged before I put it away.This is quite possibly the best product Ive ever got.

I guess Im going to have to decide if $100/year subscription to a large battery is worth it.The associated signal issue is real, but I have good-enough coverage to compensate.My only issue with the case is that when shooting video, it would creak quite loudly into the microphone. You have to be careful to hold the case in a way that does not squeeze the edges in to prevent the sound.

So, picking one up for my wifes Nexus 4 seemed the best way to help protect her phone from the ravages of her purse.From the very beginning though, I was disappointed. As with the previous three or four MilitaryShields Ive installed, I cleaned the device with optical cleaner, then a microfiber cloth. I wet the surface, applied the MilitaryShield, squeezed out the bubbles, and let it sit for two days to dry.Keep in mind, the Nexus 4 is shaped in such a way that squeezing out the bubbles is exceedingly difficult, compared to an iPad, Galaxy Tab, Galaxy S3, or S4.Unfortunately, there was terrible swirling from the adhesive, and weeks later, tiny bubbles never went away. And after just a few weeks, the protector is starting to come off. Lame. And its not like the Nexus is getting more abuse than the Galaxy phones ever have.This experience has me reconsidering buying another MilitaryShield."}

{"id": 1911, "text": "The unit (Black Lip Gloss 2200mAh Universal Mobile USB Portable Power Bank Charger) looks like an over-sized lip gloss, with dimensions 3.6x1x1. The design looks very simple and elegant, but its flaws became apparent once I started using it.- There is no on/off switch. That means the units is constantly consuming a standby current even while not in use.- There is a battery status indicator light during charging (Red=charging, Green=done). But after you plug in an USB device to the output of this unit, there is no indicator light to tell you whether the charging has started, or when the internal battery has exhausted. The only way to monitor the charging progress is to turn on the receiving USB device, and check its battery status indicator.- The output voltage is poorly regulated. I tested it by connecting a 5 ohm resistor as load to the USB port. Initially with a freshly charged internal battery, the output is 4.9V 0.98A, or close to 5W. Over the next 75 minutes, output voltage (and hence power) drops linearly with time, down to just 4V near the end. Most USB devices expect a minimum input voltage of 4.5V for charging.- The claim of 2200mAh capacity for internal lithium battery is questionable. Based on my test, the unit only produced around 5Wh of output energy (4W average power x 1.25hr). A 2.2Ah 3.7V battery pack should contain around 8Wh of energy. Even if we assume 20% power is lost in the conversion process, the calculated battery capacity is just 1.7Ah.Previously I have tested another inexpensive USB charger, theNeewer Emergency Back Up Chargerwhich operates from 2x AA batteries. The Neweer unit has a better design in that it has an on/off switch, a status indicator, and a tiny LED flashlight. On the other hand, it has lower output current (500mA max) and lower energy capacity compared to this unit. Both units work reasonably well if all I need is to recharge some low-power USB devices such as MP3 player. For higher power appliances, Ill use theOpteka BP-SC4000 High Capacity (4000mAh) Backup Batteryinstead.Additional Notes:- The product description claims High Capacity, 2200mAh, provides 2 charges for iPhone 4 (with 1420mAh battery). The math does not work out even if the internal battery were really 2200mAh. This is because the energy transfer goes through two conversions: from internal 3.7V to 5V, then from 5V to 3.7V. Assuming 30% loss during conversions, a 22200mAh battery can recharge the iPhone 4s 1420mAh battery just once.- The unit I purchased was shipped from Hong Kong and took 2 weeks to arrive. This is not a big deal for me considering how little I paid for it. But if you need it sooner, make sure to choose a vendor shipping from the US."}

{"id": 1925, "text": "iPhone 5 wallet cases are always going to have drawbacks.  Part of this is due to the size of the phone.  The phone itself is barely as wide as a credit card, so it is hard to find a wallet case that works well as a wallet and a phone case for this phone.  All that said, I have been pleased with this case over others I have tried.The credit card side is great in that it will hold 4 cards well and still stay closed.  I have not had any trouble with tearing or fraying on that side like I have on other wallet cases for my iPhone.  I particularly like the longer closing strap and stronger magnet that this case has compared to others I have tried.  It is difficult to put much cash in there, but again that is due to the size of the phone.  If the case were big enough to hold much money, you wouldnt want it as it would then be bulky and you wouldnt want to carry it.  This case has so far struck the best balance between functionality and aesthetics of any of the wallet cases I have tried so far.The only drawback I have had so far has been that since the actual phone holder is only glued down to half of the side it is on (one of the reasons I chose this case) it makes the plastic holder not as sturdy.  As one of those folks that drop my phone from time to time, I have managed to crack the part that holds the phone on the side that is not glued down.  Even so, it has done a good job of protecting the phone through those drops.  This case may be a knock off of a more expensive case, but I couldnt be happier.  I am thinking of ordering another one, since I have cracked this one.  Not that I have to yet, it is a small crack, but for the price, why not?  I am even thinking of getting a couple of other colors at this price.  After all they are cute too.UPDATE: 8-25-13 I ordered a second case this time it was a different color and a slightly different style.  The cases available are different prices, this time I got one of the 9.99 cases instead of one of the $3ish cases. Amazon sees it as the same case I guess since it is from the same listing, so I am unable to write a separate review.  It came in quick even though it was sent USPS; however the plastic box inside the envelope had been crushed with obvious marks and indentions in the case.  This is obvious shipping damage.  I have submitted it for return via the Amazon return system; the vendor has 48 hours to respond.  I will update this review as soon as I have received a response to the return request.UPDATE: 8-27-13  I received an email yesterday from the seller telling meWe are sorry to hear about the broken item. I am afraid it could be damaged during transition, especially for long distance delivery.We have reported this to our warehouse department for future improvement on packing the item.Would you please take a picture of the broken item? We need it for record purposes and also to avoid the necessity of returning it for inspection. Hope you can understand.You can rest assured that we will investigate this issue and provide a good solution for you immediately once we confirm the case.A little unexpected but, we will see how it goes.  Sending the email today.  Will update again with the resolution when it occurs.UPDATE: 9/10/13  We went on vacation for a week for the holiday and when I returned home there was a new case in the delivered mail my neighbor had brought in.  I then tossed the broken one in the trash.  They held up their end of the bargain even though it was a little time and a little hassle, but all ended well."}

{"id": 1963, "text": "This FRIEQ Universal Waterproof Case with Waterproof External Earphone is better than I expected. So far, I have had this case for a couple of days, when I received the case I was worried about the seams splitting, but it is surprisingly standing up to the phone inside.  I have a Samsung Galaxy phone with a durable case on it inside the pouch and it fits well. The case came with an armband and a lanyard; it is not my intension to use the armband. I purchase the case to use the lanyard, but if I had to use the armband, I would not. The armband fastens with a Velcro strap in my opinion will not last long, because eventually the Velcro will cease to work in a short time. I would not trust it through a vigorous work out, plus the plastic loop where the band fits is somewhat thin, and I would expect over time would split, I come to this conclusion by just putting my finger in the loop and watching how it stretches. For me, just using the lanyard works great so far, this is the reason why I purchased this case in the first place. for waterproofing it works as described, I have no complaints on this matter."}
{"id": 1964, "text": "Im really impressed with this navy blue original bumper case designed by Samsung. I also have a casemate slim case with a similar design and a smoke colored TPU case by amazon basics but ever since I recieved this case, it has been my primary case.  The navy blue color is awesome and slightly metallic looking which is cool. It actually looks better in person than in the photos. Also, this case is very thin! Its as thin as my TPU case... which was a total surprise because my casemate slim case is much thicker than this either of those cases. Although Im usually not a fan of cases which cover up the buttons on the sides, this case allows the buttons to work perfectly without having to push any harder on them. In fact, the buttons work just as good inside the case... another great surprise. You even still get that tactile feel/feedback when you are pushing down the buttons. This leads me to believe that they spent lots of time and energy making and perfecting the look, feel, and functions of this case!  The fit is perfect and its very easy to put this thing on and off the phone.Another good example is that the bumper material that goes around the sides and extends over the screen a bit has a nice slightly rubbery feel to it that makes the case feel nice in my hands and more grippy. The material itself is substantial enough to offer some protection for the sides and screen. I found this out by accidentally dropping my phone off of my table at work... about a 3 foot fall onto the hard floor!  It landed on its top right side first, and then flipped onto the screen side down.  My phone survived unscathed! Although the case did get a tiny scuff on the rubbery side that it landed on, I was very happy that my phone was protected.All in all, this may be the most perfect cell phone case I have ever owned. To make that statement is a huge deal for me... and I have owned many, many phone cases through the years. It was exactly what I was hoping for in a phone case... something very well designed, attractive, perfect fit, slim, and offers good protection.  Because it meets all of these requirements, I feel that I must give it a full 5 Stars.  I would really recommend it to anymone. The only thing I wish is that the case came in even more colors. For example, dark teal, burgundy red, and hunter green :)Pros:-Superb design, fit and finish-Ports are all easily accessible.-Bumper around sides and screen provide good protection and added grip.-Very slim!  About the same thickness as those transparent TPU cases-Great paint job on the navy blue. It looks slightly metallic too, which is awesome.-Buttons are covered by case but their functions arent impeded by the design at all! They work just as good with the case on. This was a big suprise because I usually like cases with open button ports.Cons:-Nothing. This case is amazing.  Samsung did a great job designing it!"}

The ear buds arent all that great so it isnt a headset Id use for sports/exercise given that I had them popping out just lounging around the house nor is it a great headset for things like music due to a pretty lackluster sound quality in that particular arena.

I like the black and orange. I dont like the larger and heavier-than-it-looks capsule that holds the battery and the control buttons.Still, the headset and capsule is just one more thing to lose, one more electronic to keep charged, and one more think that may break. It is difficult to find a good place for the capsule, which controls so many functions. Youll feel silly with it clipped to your shirt or blouse. It is heavy enough to pull back your collar, exposing more skin that you meant to. But youll need it there as the microphone is in the capsule.You can, of course, put it in your pocket, but your phone is probably already there. Should a call come through, instead of just using the standard earbuds which have a microphone right by your mouth, you have to pull the capsule up to you mouth and speak into it. Casual observers will think youre applying lipstick. If youre going to speak into something you have to pull out of your purse or pocket, why not just use your phone?i just dont get it. But maybe you do. Maybe you have a use case for this product that I dont. I  If so, I can tell you it paired easily with both my iPod and Galaxy Nexxus, got good sound (a little quiet) and that the control button worked well.Just because I dont find the Jabra PLAY useful doesnt mean it has no value. This is by no means a *bad* product; I just cant see a scenario in which itd be better than using wired headphones. Maybe you can.

Yes, it makes the phone marginally larger, but it slides right into my pocket without resistance.  Very helpful for when it rings in your pocket while you are driving - slips out easily.All in all, very worth the cost; everything fits so precisely.

I cleaned my screen to an immaculate level, but then I could see little specks falling on my freshly clean screen.  3 dogs and 2 cats will do that.  Probably time to change the filters.I love the matte finish as it really does eliminate the glares.  Finger prints are no longer a problem. Absolutely love the screen protector."}
{"id": 1984, "text": "I got these because I thought it would be neat to have a bunch of these in the car or at home or at work to automatically make the phone do stuff...but once you get an NFC chip next to the bed to get it into airplane mode and set the alarm, what else can you really do?While the usefulness factor will be up to the buyer, these function well and you can get an app to set up your actions.  I think you can also program these one time (permanent write) but I havent tried that, yet.The sticky part is what I took a star off for because once its stuck, you cant peel and restick it without it losing its tack."}

{"id": 1986, "text": "Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback, so Ill do my best to write an accurate, unbiased review.Perhaps I got a dud or substandard unit, but I havent gotten my spanking new 12Ah Astro 3 to charge my ipad3 more than 75% before running out of juice.  With the iPad 3 battery capacity being around 11,600 mAh,  this equates to about a 27% loss through conversion, much lower efficiency than is advertised.Im also getting less iPhone 5 charges than other users at 5 full charges, which is still good, btw. It has 3 charging ports, (one of them intelligent) whereas most batteries in this class only have 2, and bridged ones at that.Fit and finish are excellent - rubber coating provides good grip and the carrying bag is a nice padded mesh pocket.For me, the Shake to charge/status is a mixed bag, as it is a novel idea, but Im wondering how much energy is wasted by the indicator getting lit up while getting bumped all day in your bag or pocket.It was a nice surprise that the micro-USB to 30-pin adapter was included, however it is so small that I can see it getting lost very easily. Also, the short USB to micro USB cable gets very HOT when charging that battery itself, even using  Ankers which leads to the next critique, that of charging time. It was good that Anker did not include some cheap cube power adapter, as charging from one of those would be glacially slow. Plugged into Ankers own 18w 3.6A charger, it still took longer than expected to charge the battery from dead, at approximately 10-12 hours.Pros:* 3 charging ports,1 intelligent, simultaneous charging of all three* Fit and finish* 10-segment charge statusCons:* Wasted energy from shake to charge/status* Only 1 cord/tip  included* Cant charge and use battery at the same time* Slow charging of battery itselfOverall, I like this battery a lot, though Im reluctant to give it a full 5 stars based on some of the performance that Ive seen so far."}
{"id": 1987, "text": "This case is great for the money, but it does have a few issues. First, it is VERY hat to open the dock area where you plug the charger in.  So much so my husband has to use his teeth to way it apart. Secondly, there seems to be a slight warp in the screen (the plastic clear part that covers the face of the phone). This has caused some frustrations.Ok, now to the good parts!  The price! All I can say is wow. It is just as functional as a real life proof case and is affordable. Also, there are these little dots on the screen cover that keep it from getting bubbles like the real life proof tends to get.Overall, its good and bad, but to us the good dr outweighs the negative aspects of this case. We would defiantly order again."}
{"id": 1988, "text": "I got it super fast ! It is as described in picture. I never had a lifeproof case so I cant compare the two but its slim and my phone fits perfect. It came with a extra audio plug seal that hangs on to the audio water seal adaptor wire plug. I bought to try out a new case thats slimmer and water proof. I havent tested the case for water proof yet but it has all the water seals in tact so it should but I will be tested before I use near swimming pool which is recommended by seller. I havent dropped phone in case yet but I worry how it will protect from drops but everyone with life proofs say the same thing. It makes my black iPhone pink and slimmer and lighter than otter cases which looks nice. I plan to use this case occasionally when near water as my other cases are drop protection cases not water proof. You will probably want to remove the tiny piece inside the volume on off switch because it seems to just turn mine off and its aggravating to work switch. Thats not a big deal to me. I removed the tiny piece and all is good. I dont have any issues with any other buttons with the case on. I can hear easily and people can hear me fine. So no issues there either. I fill I got my moneys worth and Im happy with my case. Its recommended to check water proofing before using anytime in or around water. Test without phone in case. If you drop case anytime retest water proofing. These phones cost to much not to keep an eye on water proof cases to make sure they function properly for you device protection. Remember this isnt a otterbox so use caution when using this case or any cases. Hope this review helps!"}

I havent dropped my phone and usually dont so I cant comment on the breakage protection issue but its super cute, protects it from cosmetic damage and I am going to order several more colors.. Btw its transparent in the back... Love that too!"}

{"id": 1993, "text": "Ive been using the Yubi Power charger to charge up my power banks, Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet, my dogs GPS gadget.  Ive had no problems at all.The wall charger has fold up prongs for easy transfport, and no light to bother us at night in our hotel rooms.  It has one 1 amp port and one 2.1 amp port. Id prefer they both be 2 amps.  Thats so much faster.  This way, I have to check if I need a quick charge.For a two-port wall charger, its a little longer than Id like.  Its really not big at all, but for travel, every little bit counts.  I use it in the office, so its not a huge concern..The Yubi Power wall charger works exactly as promised.  It could use a few minor improvements to make it a great product, but Im satisfied with its performance.This product was provided for review by Yubi Power."}
{"id": 1994, "text": "My daughter begged me for a tablet stylus when we were at a book store last month.  I balked, but I bought it anyway.  She has an iPad, and hardly ever puts it down, so I knew she would use it.  Well my younger daughter took the stylus and said what is this black part? and pulled the end off.  It was just a hollow tip, just like the one on this stylus.  Our original stylus will never be the same.  This particular Belkin stylus has the same kind of black, hollow rubbery tip, which is the end you write and tap on your tablet with.  I dont know how long the tip will last, but I know I will keep it away from my daughter.  Im not sure why the stylus tip couldnt be made out of solid material, that would make it a lot sturdier.  This stylus would get five stars if it had a pen in it.  This stylus has only one use, and that is for using on a tablet.  If it had a ballpoint pen in it, at least it could be used for writing with also."}

The clip on the side of the pen easily attaches to the elastic strap on my KF cover making for easy access. Completely happy with this product."}
{"id": 1996, "text": "A stylus is one of those items that has to feel right in your hands before you can determine if it is right for you or not.  This particular design to me was perfect and it had the right amount of weight that I wanted in a stylus...feels like a good professional pen.  My only issue was that it was a tiny bit short and thus sometimes a bit difficult to use initially.  After a few days, it feels normal and I continue to use it daily.I used this on my Samsung Galaxy S4, iPhone5, and iPad Mini without any issue.  PS...the GREEN is totally cool for me.  ;)Excellent. 5/5"}

{"id": 1998, "text": "Ive had my fair share of Jabra products and I have always been happy with the quality and performance, until I got my hands on the STONE3. This is seriously not up to the Jabra standards that Ive grown accustomed to.The most important aspect of any bluetooth headset device is sound quality, sadly, the STONE3 does not meet my expectations, sound quality is mediocre at best. Battery life is even sadder, I mean, this is the first time that my bluetooth devices battery dies before my phone does!Style is very awesome, I give you that, it fits comfortable around the ear. I hope that Jabra can match the style with quality on their next project."}
