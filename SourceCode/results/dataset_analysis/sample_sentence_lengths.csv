137800,B00AGABISW,5,"I seriously buy a lot of phone cases and screen protectors.  These screen protectors last the longest for me so far.  Easy to put on and they stay. In. Place.  You get three but the one has been on my phone for months.  Spend the money on these.  They're worth it.  They are easy to install.  You'll need the right environment so a construction site is a no-no.  They supply you with the dust remover tape so that is a giant plus. Edit Sept 10, 2013:I've just removed my first one since it was a little beat up.  I've dropped a few things on my screen (not on purpose, c'mon...)and I had to replace it.  Took 3 minutes.  No dust under the screen.  At.  All. Hint:  After you clean your screen.  Use the provided tape remover tabs to get the stragglers and you shouldn't have to lift up the protector.","06 4, 2013",A2W88VUGI6DMEM,The best so far,1370304000,19
167960,B00DZ62K18,3,"Out of the box there was one thing I really liked about the M2 and M3 Bolse series was the fact that they had digital displays indicating the amount of charge left in the battery pack. I was pleased because this innovative design will allow the user to know exactly how much juice is left in the battery.  The LEDs are nice but as a rule, you'll only see three or four of them and the range of charge can be wide.  I'm used to working with these batteries and keep them charged up.  However, if you have one and only have 1 LED remaining, you may have a 1% charge or a 24% charge.  If you had a fuel gauge like that in a car, you might be driving on 1/4 of a tank or fumes.  Novel idea and I really liked it. I liked the promise of this battery, as well as the M2, until I started to test them.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I test every battery I get ... in real-time circumstances.  I use my iPad a lot and when it's powered down sufficiently I start testing.  I figured a 6600mAh battery would be able to do a sufficient job powering up an iPad with a 46% charge remaining. The M3 struggled from the start with an immediate drop in charge from 97% down to 65% in fifteen minutes.  It was then I decided to watch and record very closely what was going on. A casual approach is usually my thing, but instead of a stellar performance I'd expect from a 6600mAh battery pack, I only got an average one.  Bolse is usually a performer, but for some reason the M2 and M3 battery packs fell a bit short of my expectations.  The performance was OK, but nothing more.  If you want a Bolse, which is an excellent brand, I'd look at the AON series, which really performed spectacularly.  I'm rating this one a three, which is OK, on the Amazon scale.
